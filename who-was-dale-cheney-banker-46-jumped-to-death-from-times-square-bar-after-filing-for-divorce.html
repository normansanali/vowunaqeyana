As per New York Post, police were called to his former Upper East Side home twice in 2008 over domestic disputes with his wife. One of the arguments was over finances. They moved out of Manhattan and shifted to Connecticut in 2010. And bought their present house in 2018 for $1.6 million. The estimated market value of the house is now more than $3.8 million.</p><h2 class=split>'F**ked up situation'</h2><p>Narrating the details of when the incident happened, Chris Piralta, a parking attendant said, as quoted by New York Post, "It was like a little bump, like boom." Nino Rodriguez, another parking attendant, explained, "Everybody was nervous. I had some woman come through here and she said ‘someone jumped.’ She had big eyes."</p><p>A hotel worker described the incident and said, "It’s a f**ked up situation. It’s unfortunate.” While Tom Blundell, the general manager of the Hyatt Centric Times Square, commented, "We are truly heartbroken at the situation that occurred this evening outside our rooftop bar, and we are keeping the victim’s family and friends in our thoughts and hearts. We are working closely with local authorities. The safety and wellbeing of all our colleagues, hotel guests and Bar 54 guests remains a top priority, and at this time, as a result of this tragic incident, we will keep the door to the bar’s outdoor space locked at all times."</p><h2 class=split>Who was Dale Cheney?</h2><p>Cheney was the founder of T-street Capital, a private investment fund, which he established in 2013 in Darien, Connecticut, states his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LinkedIn</a> profile. However, before starting his own firm, he worked as an investment principal at Citicorp Venture Capital dating back to 2007, and before that, he worked as an investment banking associate at Goldman Sachs for two years from 2005.
