Truthfully, a woman’s fortitude and ability to persevere determine who she is just as much as her physical attractiveness. Kayce Smith is one such woman who has achieved not just fame as a sportscaster but also the status of survivor thanks to her incredible fight against melanoma cancer.</strong></p><p>The stress of everyday life is bad enough, but when cancer is thrown into the mix, it can feel unbearable. In contrast, Smith was never the type to give up in the face of adversity. She showed incredible strength of character and determination to overcome incredible odds during her medical treatment.</p><p>The American returned to her regular broadcasting duties, becoming a role model and motivation to young men and women going through similar situations.</p><p>Today, we explore Kayce Smith’s background and career as a host in further detail. We will also talk about her early life, schooling, professional life, wealth, and marital status.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Kayce_Smith_Salary_Earnings><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"What is the Net Worth of ABC? Salary, Earnings"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4480,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial"}'>What is the Net Worth of Kayce Smith? Salary, Earnings</span></span></h2><p>For instance, after working as a reporter, host, and sportscaster for ten years, Kayce amassed an astounding $2 million in wealth. Her exact compensation is a mystery, but it’s likely well into the five figures.</p><p>The average annual salary of a sportscaster is said to be between <strong>$50,000 and $55,000</strong> per various web resources. In a similar vein, salaries can go up to $84k if one is in a high-level position.</p><p>At the same time, we think that the gender pay gap exists not only in the broadcasting industry but in others as well. Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, women with skills like Kayce’s will be compensated more fairly.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Kayce_Smith_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Where was ABC born?

Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></span></h2><p>On October 25, 1988 (USA), Kayce Smith was born in Texas. In addition, her proud father, Ron Smith, and an unknown woman gave birth to her. Ally Elaine Smith has an elder sister named Kayce.</p><p>She is also a native-born American citizen of the Caucasian race.<br>Furthermore, Smith is a Scorpio, as indicated by horoscopes. The horoscope predicts that the sportscaster will be secretive, driven, and determined.</p><p>Because Scorpios are notoriously private, many details of her formative years remain shrouded in mystery. However, Kayce did go to college, graduating from Texas A&M University with a BA in Communication.</p><p>The Texan’s enthusiasm for athletics and her desire to become a journalist often came into conflict. It now seems natural for someone to be both a sports fan and a broadcaster.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto" class=mytable width=100%><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Kayce Smith</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>October 25, 1988</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td>Kayce</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Undefined</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Texas A&M University</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>Ron Smith</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Yes (Ally Elaine Smith)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>33 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>5’9″ (1.77 m)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>Unavailable</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Grey</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure</strong></td><td>Curvy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Married</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Boyfriend</strong></td><td>Nathan Sebesta</td></tr><tr><td><b>Children</b></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Sports Broadcaster and Host</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td>$50,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Currently Works At</strong></td><td>Barstool Sports</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Affiliations</strong></td><td>NBC, ESPN</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Active Since</strong></td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td>Instagram,&nbsp;Twitter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>2021</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Kayce_Smith_Weight_Hair_Color><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"How tall is ABC?

The Texas reporter cares about his health.</p><p>Being on camera can be stressful and nerve-wracking for anyone, and to be perfectly honest, her attractiveness is only a bonus to her technical prowess.</p><p>Kayce has grey eyes, blonde waves, a skinny build, and a sharp nose that set her apart from the others.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Kayce_Smith_start_his_Professional_Career><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"How did ABC start his Professional Career?"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":5025,"3":{"1":0},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":{"1":2,"2":0}},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial"}'>How did Kayce Smith start his Professional Career?</span></span></h2><p>Similarly, the Texan put together an inventive group to debut The Kayce Smith Show two years and two arduous months later. Gridiron Now and Nation National Radio joined together to promote the program.</p><p>The show was a hit, yet it was canceled after only six months. In addition, beginning in March 2018, Smith hosted NBC Sports Boston. His tenure will last a full year.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Texan had proven her worth by working for several networks and exhibiting her talents on a variety of platforms, so she was ready for a new challenge with Barstool Sports.</p><p>He is still working for Dave Portnoy’s network as a sportscaster.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Chris Santos, Shawn Kemp, and Aabha Bakaya."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":35}{"1":41,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":53}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/chris-santos/"}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":"https://popularbio.com/shawn-kemp/"}{"1":35}{"1":41,"2":"https://popularbio.com/aabha-bakaya/"}{"1":53}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Chris Santos</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Shawn Kemp</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aabha Bakaya</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>host</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Sports Broadcaster</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jeff Burton Passed Away At The Age Of 55</a></h3>The Rizzuto Show host Jeff Burton passed away on August 15 at the age of 55.
