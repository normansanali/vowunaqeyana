But there was also another reason the Duke parted ways with his childhood sweetheart.&nbsp;</p><p id=eL3XOz-NDl data-wc=33>In <a class=hm-link href=#>his bombshell novel Spare</a>, which shocked royal watchers when it was published pre-emptively in January, he revealed that he was worried his grandmother wouldn't approve of his love match.&nbsp;</p><p id=eTKZh2AdpAR data-wc=24>In the novel, Harry recalled a conversation with his friend Teej, who asked him <a class=hm-link href=#>whether he could see himself married</a> to his then-girlfriend Chelsy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5a8ccc0ff418-prince-harry-kissing-chelsy-davy.jpg><p id=ehl0O0BFcNF data-wc=67>He wrote: "Teej asked point-blank if I could see myself married to Chels[...] She wore short skirts and high boots, danced with abandon, drank as much tequila as I did, and I cherished all those things about her… but I couldn't help worrying how <a class=hm-link href=#>Granny</a> might feel about them. Or the British public. And the last thing I wanted was for Chels to change to accommodate them."&nbsp;</p><p id=euz-JHDqcI data-wc=59>The Duke had a very special connection with his former flame, writing: "Unlike so many people I knew, she seemed wholly unconcerned with appearances, with propriety, with royalty. Unlike so many girls I met, she wasn't visibly fitting herself for a crown the moment she shook my hand. She seemed immune to that common affliction sometimes called throne syndrome."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6ecbe442916e-prince-harry-chelsy-davy-dancing.jpg><p id=eFGD-lnHn_ data-wc=39>But according to the Duke, it wasn't just his worries about his late grandmother that <a class=hm-link href=#>caused the relationship to suffer</a> as Chelsy struggled with media intrusion from early on, including walking to and from her lectures at Leeds University.&nbsp;</p><p id=eGG9x1OSBm data-wc=75>Harry penned: "Chels told me that paps had been following her to and from lectures—she asked me to do something about it. I told her I'd try. I told her how sorry I was. When she was back in Cape Town she phoned me and said people were tailing her everywhere and it was driving her crazy. <a class=hm-link href=#>She couldn't imagine how they always knew where she was</a> and where she'd be. She was freaking out."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/959e8a8eaede-harry-chelsy.jpg><p id=eqYddAAMU4 data-wc=86>These were the sentiments echoed when Harry gave evidence this week. Talking about how he initially prepared Chelsy to cope with the media, he wrote: "I advised Chelsy to treat it like a chronic illness, something to be managed. But she wasn't sure she wanted to have a chronic illness. I told her I understood. Perfectly valid feeling. But this was my life, and if she wanted to share any part of it, she'd have to share this too. You get used to it, I lied."&nbsp;</p><p id=e6FuWxuBSK data-wc=14>He added: "Odds were, the press would cost me another person I cared about."</p><p id=eflvJ9hdG-9 data-wc=27></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfp7y6rcutsGhsaWp9eIKOq5yapF2nsqK%2FzqdkqaqZo7CmeceaqauxXZi1prjSsmSdmaauerS8y6KraA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiktok-hoax-and-plastic-ban-explained-are-forks-banned-in-canada.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TikTok hoax and plastic ban explained: Are forks banned in Canada?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./love-is-blind-season-6-rankings-best-worst-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Love Is Blind Season-6 Power Rankings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
