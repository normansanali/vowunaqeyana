He showed an interest in music and dance from a young age, winning national dance contests by the age of 13. At 15, he landed a role on the cast of The Mickey Mouse Club, which marked the beginning of his career in show business.</p><p>Despite his shyness outside of his home, JC overcame it through performing and honing his skills in music and dance. He eventually added singing to his repertoire, making him a triple threat in the entertainment industry.</p><h2><span id=JC_Chasezs_Early_Career>JC Chasez’s Early Career</span></h2><p>Chasez became a member of The Mickey Mouse Club after his mother saw an advertisement for open auditions. He was a part of the show from the fourth season until its end in 1996. During his time on the show, he met Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Ryan Gosling. Chasez also became a professional songwriter at the age of 18, penning the song “Give Me The Love I Need” for jazz saxophonist Euge Groove’s debut album, which featured Chasez’s lead vocals.</p><h2><span id=NSYNC_Fame_and_Collaborations>*NSYNC Fame and Collaborations</span></h2><p>Chasez rose to fame as a member of the boy band *NSYNC, formed by Lou Perlman. The band released three studio albums which sold 11 million copies of their debut album and gained popularity worldwide. They also performed at major events like the World Series, the Super Bowl, and the Olympic Games. Chasez collaborated with major artists such as Elton John, Mary J. Blige, Michael Jackson, and more.</p><p>During his time with *NSYNC, Chasez occasionally worked on his own, such as lending guest vocals to the track “Bring It All To Me” by the group Blaque in 1998.</p><h2><span id=JC_Chasezs_Career_After_NSYNC>JC Chasez’s Career After *NSYNC</span></h2><p>After *NSYNC’s popularity declined, JC Chasez started his solo career with the 2002 single “Blowin’ Me Up (With Her Love),” which he co-produced. He released his solo album, Schizophrenic, in 2004, but its promotion was compromised due to the infamous Super Bowl halftime performance of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake. Chasez left Jive Records in 2007, which resulted in the shelving of his second album, The Story of Kate, despite Timberlake’s involvement in its production. In addition to his solo career, Chasez wrote and produced for various music acts and served as a judge for America’s Best Dance Crew on MTV from 2008 to 2012. In 2012, he was involved in the formation of a girl group called Girl Radical and joined the cast of Jesus Christ Superstar, but the show was canceled due to low ticket sales. In 2015, he appeared on a Blues Traveler track and in 2016, he appeared in the comedy film Opening Night.</p><h2><span id=Chasezs_Luxurious_Properties>Chasez’s Luxurious Properties</span></h2><p>Chasez, a former member of *NSYNC, has owned at least two luxurious properties. The first was a mansion in Orlando, Florida, which he and his parents bought for $1.2 million during the band’s peak in 2000. He sold it later for $1.775 million. The second property is a home in Los Angeles that he bought for a little over a million dollars in the same year.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC2wmaaoZmjmsduusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jed-castles-gameday-long-sleeve-tee.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jed Castles &amp;quot;Gameday&amp;quot; Long Sleeve Tee</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jasmine-guy-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jasmine Guy Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
