ABC announced the pro dancers set for season 29 of <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> on Tuesday, August 18, and revealed that the new season is right around the corner.</p><p>The upcoming competition, hosted by <a href=#><strong>Tyra Banks</strong></a>, is set to premiere on Monday, September 14, at 8 p.m. ET. Although the celebrities have not yet been revealed, the announcement shares that a few fan favorite professional dancers are returning, including season 27 winner <a href=#><strong>Sharna Burgess</strong></a> and nine-time dancer <a href=#><strong>Keo Motsepe</strong></a>.</p><p>This season also includes news pro dancers <strong>Britt Stewart</strong> and <strong>Daniella Karagach</strong>. In season 23, Stewart, 30, became the first Black female pro to have a full-time role in the show, joining the troupe. Karagach, who is married to pro <strong>Pasha Pashkov</strong>, was part of the troupe last season.</p><p>The reveal comes just one month after <a href=#><strong>Tom Bergeron</strong></a> shared that <a href=#>he would not be returning</a> as the show’s host.</p><p>“Just informed @DancingABC will be continuing without me,” the former America’s Funniest Videos host, 65, tweeted in July. “It’s been an incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> of my career. I’m grateful for that and for the lifelong friendships made. That said, now what am I supposed to do with all of these glitter masks?”</p><p>The comedian, who has hosted show since its 2004 debut, was not the only one let go. Following his news, the network announced that cohost <a href=#><strong>Erin Andrews</strong></a>, who joined the series in season 14, was also leaving.</p><p>“As we <a href=#>embark on a new creative direction</a>, he departs the show with our sincerest thanks and gratitude for his trademark wit and charm that helped make this show a success. Erin will also not be returning, and we appreciate all that she brought to the ballroom,” BBC and ABC said in a joint statement at the time. “Fans have been rooting for her since she originally competed as a contestant back in 2010, and her signature sense of humor has become a hallmark of the show.”</p><p>Shortly after the news, Banks, 46, was<a href=#> revealed as the new host</a>. When Us Weekly asked the America’s Next Top Model creator about how she felt about the new role, <a href=#>she had a one-word answer</a>: “Pressure!”</p><p>Although the supermodel will definitely make a splash, many of the pros have <a href=#>revealed how taken aback they were</a> by the announcement.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“<a href=#>It was shocking</a>,” Burgess, 35, told Us on August 7, noting that she’s hopeful to see what’s next. “You know, Dancing is trying to figure out how to change things up and make it exciting for our fans without losing too much of what they love — but maybe giving them something they didn’t know they wanted.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below for the full list of pro dancers for season 29:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZrq%2BvyKeeZq%2BZqbVuwMeeZKyskafAbr%2FEmqqopl1nhm680aiqZqiimrqqsdGeZJ2ZpJp6s7HVnpilnZRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./manga-like-reality-quest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 manga Like Reality Quest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-valtteri-bottas-ex-wife-emilia-bottas-everything-on-her-net-worth-more-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Valtteri Bottas Ex Wife Emilia Bottas?
