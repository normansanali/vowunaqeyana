"A happy picture taken of us celebrating Megan’s 18th, I was just under 20 weeks pregnant. Little did we know, a few days later I would be holding our little boy Rocky - born with a strong heartbeat, but too little to survive.&nbsp;</p><p id=euQ5OiPMY5q5 data-wc=47>"Although it’s 7 years today, it still feels like yesterday. We all miss you everyday. We love you Rocky, forever in our hearts.

And secondly, I'm going to be the oldest [expletive] at school. 'Who's your grandad?' &nbsp;And what about sports day? The egg and spoon race. What am I going to do? So, I'd love another one, but no."</p><p id=ewj1LYFLIMOD data-wc=25>The chef revealed back in 2021 that they were "contemplating" having another baby, adding that they were inspired to do so after welcoming baby Oscar.</p><p id=eVHpEzu-uhP- data-wc=55>"We discussed having another baby.
