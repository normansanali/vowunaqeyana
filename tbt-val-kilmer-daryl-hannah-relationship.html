He claimed to have cried every single day for six months following the breakup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kilmer said he would've "done anything to win [Daryl] back," and that he knew he'd "love her with my whole heart forever."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That love – invisible, ephemeral, and infinite – has lost none of its strength," he went on.
