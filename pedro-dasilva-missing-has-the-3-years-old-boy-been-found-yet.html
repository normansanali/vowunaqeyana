Around 9:55 a.m., authorities released an AMBER Alert regarding the missing youngster.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Pedro Dasilva?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>An Amber alert was issued when a three-year-old boy was reported taken; he has since been found. According to authorities, Pedro DaSilva was removed from Newark, New Jersey on Tuesday morning.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Prior to now, police had stated that they were looking for a white male suspect who had driven away in a silver Hyundai Sonata bearing the registration plate S27-SLD.</p><p>He was said to be dressed in black North Face sneakers, black jeans, and a black jacket. The boy’s picture remained undisclosed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>Is Pedro Dasilva Still Missing?</strong></h2><p>According to authorities, a three-year-old youngster who had gone missing was discovered safe inside a car that had been taken from Newark.</p><p>On Wilson Avenue, close to Komorn Street, on Tuesday morning, the vehicle was reported stolen. Around 9:55 a.m., authorities released an AMBER Alert regarding the missing youngster.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He was recovered unharmed, according to the police, at 10:30 a.m. On Liberty Avenue in Jersey City, he was found inside the pilfered vehicle.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The youngster was observed being loaded into an ambulance, and a woman who was reportedly related to him—possibly his mother—was led to a police vehicle so that they could be reunited.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The child may have been left in the car with the keys inside, or the car may have been taken from the driver violently; these are all matters under investigation by the police.</p><h2><strong>How Did Pedro Dasilva Go Missing?</strong></h2><p>The fact that Pedro Dasilva was last seen wearing grey jeans and a red hoodie is crucial information that can help ensure his safe return. There is no way to stress how urgent this issue is—a small child’s safety and well-being are on the line.</p><p>His well-being is of great concern to his friends, family, and the community at large. Pedro was driving a stolen car at the time of the event, which made the already difficult situation even worse.</p><p>The vehicle is identified as a grey 2017 Hyundai Elantra and stands out from the crowd because of obvious damage to the front passenger side. If this car is seen in the neighborhood, it is imperative that you identify it. This grey 2017 Hyundai Elantra is registered under the license plate NJ S27-SLD in New Jersey.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Authorities had earlier stated that they thought the youngster was in the company of a man driving a silver Hyundai Sonata with the New Jersey license plate S27-SLD, who was dressed in black Northface clothes, black jeans, and white sneakers.</p><p>The youngster had been abandoned in a moving car in Newark earlier in the morning, a representative for the sheriff’s office confirmed.</p><p>According to the State Police, amber alerts are meant to be sent out when there is cause for concern that a kid has been taken and could be in danger of dying or suffering severe physical harm. Not every case of a missing child, runaway, or custody dispute is meant for an Amber Alert.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC8xJ2pqGWUlsCquNWaZKaho6i2r7OMoZisZaSdsm5%2FjLKcmqqjYrytsIybprJlkpqyr3nFqKynnF2usrV7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./was-norman-lear-jewish-tv-legend-religion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Was Norman Lear Jewish?
