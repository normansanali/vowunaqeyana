The popular reality television competition series typically airs on Wednesdays, but it ran over the weekend this week to make up for missing episodes due to an earlier baseball game.&nbsp;The Masked Singer featured a ’90s-themed night this week. The Lambs, the Walrus, and Milkshake were the three masked celebrities that performed. They competed against each other for a place in the semi-finals. Unfortunately, only one of them survived, and that was the Lambs.</p><p>The Walrus was the first participant to be eliminated and exposed this week. The Walrus was unveiled after earning the fewest votes from the studio audience, and it turned out to be actor Joey Lawrence, as fans had anticipated.&nbsp;However, viewers were dissatisfied with the removal. Many people were relieved when the Lambs survived, but many were surprised that the Milkshake gained more votes than the Walrus.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Walrus-1.jpg alt=Walrus width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“The Walrus is way better”: According to The Masked Singer fans, the Walrus’ performance was superior to the Milkshake’s.&nbsp;Fans flocked to Twitter to voice their thoughts, claiming that the Walrus was superior to the Milkshake. Some also said that his time in the tournament was cut too short and that he deserved to compete in the Battle Royale.&nbsp;Fans also wondered how the Milkshake defeated the Walrus.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>honestly i think The Walrus deserves to be king on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#TheMaskedSinger</a>, don’t get me wrong I love The Lambs but I want to see Walrus go through</p><p>— 💜 Theo 💜 (@TheodoreStorm__) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">November 7, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>THE WALRUS?!

Robin Thicke, Ken Jeong, Nicole Scherzinger, and Jenny McCarthy all returned to the panel as judges.&nbsp;The Walrus gave the opening performance of the evening. The clue package showed the Walrus at a mall, surrounded by shouting admirers. He said in the video montage that he writes signatures and takes photographs with mothers:</p><p>“It all began when I tap danced on a late-night talk show legend’s desk. That was just the start of my heartthrob genesis narrative. Consider this: a flannel shirt, a leather jacket, floppy hair, a fantastic zip code, and a catchphrase that is still popular. However, every adolescent idol must mature. As a result, I took on new jobs and met a whole new generation of streaming enthusiasts.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Walrus-2.jpg alt=Walrus width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There was a Full House hint, a musical note on a red heart, Jenny the cat, and a red shirt among the visual clues. The Walrus did a cover of Spin Doctors’ Two Princes. Finally, only Robin Thicke got it right when it came to identifying who was behind the mask, as he picked Joey Lawrence.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>The Masked Singer</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Walrus Mask</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwc2dnKtlpJ2ybsPApamuq12irrS3jKKlZqyYmnqurdKknJ1lo567qLHRaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-was-jack-sonni-cause-of-death-net-worth-age-career-dire-straits-and-more-674792-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who was Jack Sonni?
