His mother, Roxie Roker, was famous before him.</h2><p>Even though Lenny and his daughter, <a href=#>Zoë Kravitz</a>, are who fans fawn over nowadays, the rocker's parents made quite a name for themselves long before he was even born. Lenny's mother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roxie Roker</a>, was an actress who was active from 1974 to 1995. Lenny's father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sy Kravitz</a>, was a television producer, who married Roxie back in 1962. The couple welcomed Lenny just two years after getting hitched in 1964. Unfortunately, their marriage didn't last; Roxie and Sy were divorced by 1985.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenny's young life had two different religions</a> present in it, but he remained agnostic throughout those years. His mother was Christian and of African-American and Bahamian descent. As for the singer's father, Sy was of Russian and Jewish descent. However, by the time he was 13, Lenny became a nondenominational Christian. Before their divorce, Lenny and his parents lived together on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Roxie Roker was famous for her work on 'The Jeffersons.'</h2><p>The most famous role of Roxie's career was when she portrayed Helen Willis on the CBS sitcom The Jeffersons.
