He started his career as a police officer before turning to drug trafficking.</p><p>His rise to power was swift, and by the 1980s, he was one of the most powerful drug lords in Mexico.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=establishment-of-the-guadalajara-cartel-smVnhMHfrh>Establishment of the Guadalajara Cartel</h2><p>Félix Gallardo founded the Guadalajara Cartel in the late 1970s.</p><p>The cartel quickly gained control of most of the drug trafficking in Mexico and the corridors along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p><p>The cartel’s operations were highly profitable, contributing significantly to Félix Gallardo’s wealth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=peak-of-power-and-wealth-smVnhMHfrh>Peak of Power and Wealth</h2><p>At the height of his power in the mid-1980s, Félix Gallardo was reportedly worth around $500 million.</p><p>His wealth came from the vast drug trafficking operations he controlled, which included the production, transportation, and sale of marijuana and cocaine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=downfall-and-arrest-smVnhMHfrh>Downfall and Arrest</h2><p>Félix Gallardo’s downfall began in the late 1980s when he was implicated in the murder of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent.</p><p>He was arrested in 1989 and has been in prison since then. His arrest led to the fragmentation of the Guadalajara Cartel into several smaller cartels.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=current-net-worth-smVnhMHfrh>Current Net Worth</h2><p>Since his arrest, Félix Gallardo’s net worth has significantly decreased. His assets were seized by the Mexican government, and his income sources were cut off.</p><p>As of 2024, it is difficult to estimate his current net worth accurately, but it is believed to be significantly less than at the height of his power.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=factors-affecting-felix-gallardos-net-worth-smVnhMHfrh>Factors Affecting Félix Gallardo’s Net Worth</h2><ul><li><h3 id=illegal-nature-of-his-wealth-smVnhMHfrh>Illegal Nature of His Wealth</h3><p>Since Félix Gallardo’s wealth was acquired through illegal activities, it was susceptible to seizure by the government. This factor significantly affected his net worth following his arrest.</p></li><li><h3 id=imprisonment-smVnhMHfrh>Imprisonment</h3><p>Being in prison, Félix Gallardo has no means of increasing his wealth. His net worth has likely decreased over the years due to the lack of income and the costs associated with his legal defense.</p></li><li><h3 id=fragmentation-of-the-guadalajara-cartel-smVnhMHfrh>Fragmentation of the Guadalajara Cartel</h3><p>The fragmentation of the Guadalajara Cartel after Félix Gallardo’s arrest also affected his net worth. He lost control over the cartel’s operations, which were a significant source of his wealth.</p></li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=conclusion-smVnhMHfrh>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, Félix Gallardo was once one of the wealthiest drug lords in Mexico, with an estimated net worth of $500 million at the height of his power.</p><p>However, his arrest and the subsequent seizure of his assets by the government have significantly reduced his net worth.</p><p>As of 2024, it is difficult to estimate his current net worth accurately due to his imprisonment and the illegal nature of his wealth.</p><p>Despite his notorious past, Félix Gallardo’s story serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of illegal activities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qq3MoKalnKCWu6WtjZympmeWmrmqxIygmKWkkaexsHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5kWlpbWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gavin-lux-heritage-hoodie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gavin Lux Heritage Hoodie | Fan Arch</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./watch-are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-curse-of-the-shadows-cast-talk-new-season-set-secrets-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Curse of the Shadows Cast Talk New Season, Set Secrets &amp;amp; More Celeb Secrets</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
