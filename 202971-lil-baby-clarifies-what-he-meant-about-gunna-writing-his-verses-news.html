Of course, admitting that someone else wrote your songs is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">still somewhat of a faux pas in hip-hop</a>. Baby began to get a ton of hate for it. However, he recently clarified the statements in an interview with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Big Boi</a> but it seemed like he was doing a bit more backtracking than anything else.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Gunna ain't never wrote no song for me," he said. "He just showed me how to rap, like, if he wrote a song, he wrote like what I got going on," he added.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the previous interview that he did when he first spoke about his relationship with Gunna,&nbsp;he blatantly stated that he paid Gunna to write his raps. But he did clarify none of those songs ever made it out; they were more like references for practice.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I done paid Gunna to write my songs. I never put the songs out but when I first started to rap, I used to like pay him $100 to like, 'Like I'mma give you a hundred, write something for me so I could go in and learn how to record it.' Like I ain't never like, recorded the songs and put 'em out but that's how I used to like practice," he said.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
