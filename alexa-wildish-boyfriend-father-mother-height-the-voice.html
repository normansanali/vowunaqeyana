Alexa was part of the final batch of contestants to hit the singing competition stage on (Nov. 14.) For her song choice, she decided to put her own stamp on none other than Cher‚Äôs ‚ÄúBelieve.‚Äù</p><p>Her rendition of a timeless song, Alexa, secured her a playoff berth. According to her coach Niall Horan, ‚Äúshe is a one-in-a-million talent,‚Äù which is why he picked Wildish over VanderDoes and Roome.</p><p>Many people forgot about the actual singer when Alexa brought her version of Cher to the Knockouts stage.

She had been traveling around every state in the West in a van for the past year, singing her songs as she went. This was her way of pursuing her wanderlust. Now she‚Äôs arrived in Lyons, Colorado, a small mountain music town.</p><p>Her creative music is characterized by a polished vocal style with elements of Celtic, big-hearted country, and Americana influences. Alexa, who won the songwriting competition at the 2019 Rocky Mountain Folks Festival, sang live on stage with a full band at Planet Bluegrass in August 2021. Her songs invite listeners to experience the richness of life by delving into the immense reservoir of human emotions with humor and levity.</p><p>Producers Dan Knobler and Russell Durham worked with musicians including Ruth Moody (Wailin‚Äô Jennys) and Jordan Tice (Hawktail) to record her self-titled EP at Goosehead Palace.</p><p>Her dad‚Äôs passion for collecting vintage guitars inspired Alexa‚Äôs love for acoustic stringed instruments, which led to her playing guitar and octave mandolin. She took voice lessons from the age of five, started classical voice training at seven, and went on to study musical theater through high school at OCSA.</p><p>Alexa‚Äôs deep love for the Americana music scene came when she saw the Wailin‚Äô Jennys perform at a festival when she was 17. Life came full circle when a member of that band sang harmonies on Alexa‚Äôs debut EP in 2018.</p><p>A few years later, Alexa began couch surfing and really wanted to experience life in a mobile home/touring vehicle. A friend offered her his loaded-out van, and Alexa spent the following months living out of it and traveling wherever her next gig would take her.</p><p>Check out Alexa‚Äôs music on her <a href=#>Spotify</a>.</p><h3><strong>Does Alexa Wildish Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Alexa Wildish is very private about her dating life.
