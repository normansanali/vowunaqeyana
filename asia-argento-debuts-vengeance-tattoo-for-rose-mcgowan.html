Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”</p><p>Argento has been feuding with McGowan, 45, since the Jawbreaker star <a href=#>released a statement</a> about the sexual assault allegations made against Argento by former child actor <strong>Jimmy Bennett</strong>.</p><p>“It is a shame that <a href=#>@rosemcgowan</a> is not prepared to accept when she is wrong,” Argento tweeted on September 7.</p><p>Her message came nearly two weeks after the Brave author released a statement accusing Argento of <a href=#>sending her partner, model <strong>Rain Dove</strong></a>, texts in which the Marie Antoinette star revealed that she had slept with Bennett, now 22, and had been receiving inappropriate pictures from the musician since he was 12 years old. “Rain also shared that Asia had stated that she’d been receiving unsolicited nudes of Jimmy since he had been 12. Asia mentioned in these texts that she didn’t take any action on those images,” McGowan said at the time. “No reporting to authorities, to the parents, or blocking of Jimmy’s social media. Not even a simple message ‘Don’t send me these images. They are inappropriate.’”</p><p>Bennett claimed to <a href=#>The New York Times</a> in August that Argento, who played his mom in the 2004 film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, assaulted him in a hotel room in Marina del Rey, California, in 2013, by kissing him and performing oral sex.</p><p>Court documents between lawyers for Argento and Bennett obtained by the publication also claimed that she had <a href=#>arranged to pay him $380,000</a> in exchange for his silence.</p><p>Argento <a href=#>denied the claims</a> with a statement to New York magazine on August 21. “I am deeply shocked and hurt having read the news that is absolutely false,” she said at the time. “I have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett.”</p><p>She later <a href=#>accused Bennett of sexually assaulting</a> her on the evening in question, saying that he “attacked” her.</p><p>Bennett’s lawyer, <strong>Gordon K. Sattro</strong>, <a href=#>responded to her claims</a> with an exclusive statement to Us Weekly in September.</p><p>“If I were to sum up the letter from Asia and her attorney in a single word it would be ‘hypocritical,’ with a close second being ‘non-sensical,” he said. “We read this statement as a self-serving and slanderous one which is offensive, not only to my client, but in all likelihood to victims both silent and outspoken, everywhere. It would seem that Asia is implying that her truth is the actual truth because of her perceived position in this all too important movement and a delusional view of her own importance to it.”</p><p>The #MeToo activist, who had bonded with McGowan after they both went public with <a href=#>accusations of sexual misconduct</a> against producer <a href=#><strong>Harvey Weinstein</strong></a>, threatened to sue McGowan over her response to the scandal with a tweet on September 17: “Dear<a href=#> @RoseMcGowan</a>. It is with genuine regret that I am giving you 24 hours to retract and apologise for the horrendous lies made against me in your statement of August 27th. If you fail to address this libel I will have no option other than to take immediate legal action,” she wrote.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dear <a href=#>@RoseMcGowan</a>.

In fact, I had misunderstood the messages Asia had sent my partner Rain Dove, which made clear that Jimmy had sent Asia inappropriate text messages only after they met up again when he was 17 (still legally a minor in California, but notably different from a 12 year old).”</p><p>Argento was not fully satisfied with the correction, <a href=#>responding on Twitter</a>&nbsp;that while she appreciated the apology, it hadn’t come soon enough. “if she had issued it earlier, I may have kept my job on X-Factor and avoided the constant accusations of paedophilia which I have been subjected to in real-life and online,” she wrote, adding, “Now go on, live your life and stop hurting other people, will you Rose?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaq5mWeqK%2Bxp6lraddmbKjwdOsZK%2BdnpyyorrCnmStmaSpvLB5xaipZqqfqLJuucKgprCZnmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-eat-tuna-while-pregnant.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can You Eat Tuna While Pregnant?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-the-upshaws-journey-christine-parents-meet-her-mom-selina-scott-342254-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are The Upshaws Journey Christine Parents?
