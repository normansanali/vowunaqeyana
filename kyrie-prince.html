However, he is sure to attract many lovers in the future through his talent and charms.</p><p>Talking about his parent’s relationship status, Damien and Biannca are married to each other after dating each other for several years.</p><p>Damien proposed to Biannca in a YouTube video shared on 20 November 2016. The lovers then married less than a year later, in March 2017.</p><p>At present, the couple has four children namely DJ, Kyrie, Nova, and Ayla Faith.

Kyrie was born on December 11, 2016, and the youngest family member, Ayla, was born on 26 October 2020.</p><h4>Their Beginning</h4><p>Kyrie’s parents met each other back in the summer of 2012. At the time, Damien and Biannca both worked at a Little Caesars Pizza restaurant in their hometown, Fort Wayne, Indiana. They were just co-workers for a long time before they began dating.</p><p>The lovers then started to encounter various issues and some were related to their financial situation. At one point, the couple was completely broke and had to leave their apartment and move into a motel.</p><p>After their first son, DJ was born, Kyrie’s mother once had to ask her mother for money so she could purchase food.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-81637 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kyrie-Prince-posing-for-a-photo-with-his-whole-family.jpg alt="Kyrie Prince" width=650 height=808 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-81637 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Kyrie Prince posing for a photo with his whole family. Source: Instagram</p><p>It was Kyrie’s father, Damien’s decision to start a YouTube channel. He hoped that it would garner people’s attention and relieve at least some of their financial woes.</p><p>The original channel was set up on 11 March 2016 and they posted the first video on the channel in June of the same year. This channel is now called “D&B Nation”.</p><p>Initially, Kyrie’s parents had named the channel “Couple Reacts” but as they began making other types of videos, such as vlogs, live streams, challenges, Q&As, pranks, etc., they rebranded it as “D&B Nation.”</p><p>The family eventually had to find themselves a manager as the channel grew exponentially over some time.</p><h4>More Details</h4><p>On 23 August 2016, Damien and Biannca established another channel “The Prince Family.” In November, during her baby shower when she was pregnant with Kyrie, Damien proposed to her.</p><p>After Kyrie’s birth, his mother was diagnosed with postpartum depression, or PPD. It is a type of mood disorder that both sexes (predominantly women) can experience after childbirth.</p><p>When they planned to get married, Damien’s father showed up and voiced his objection to the couple’s union. The situation only escalated from there as Damien got into a physical altercation with his father and Kyrie’s mother started crying.</p><p>Eventually, things did settle down and the lovers were able to complete the ceremony. Since then, the fans have questioned the legibility of the entire situation.</p><p>In 2017, the family’s channel was taken over by a hacker. However, it turned out to be a prank orchestrated by one of their affiliates. It was a Las Vegas-based entrepreneur named Brad Lea.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-81636 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kyrie-Prince-and-his-brother-DJ-Prince-posing-for-a-photo-with-their-father-Damien-Prince.jpg alt="Kyrie Prince" width=650 height=732 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-81636 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Kyrie Prince and his brother DJ Prince posing for a photo with their father Damien Prince.
