The legal troubles began when Miller filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010, claiming her dance studio was in dire financial straits. However, the success of Dance Moms and the income it generated weren't fully disclosed in her bankruptcy filings.</p><p>The prosecution alleged that Miller hid approximately $775,000 of income earned from the television show, its spin-offs, and merchandise sales. This concealed income was a direct violation of bankruptcy laws, which require full disclosure of assets and earnings to ensure creditors can be fairly compensated.</p><p>Miller was also accused of smuggling over $120,000 into the U.S. from Australia in 2014, which she had earned from conducting dance instruction classes. She reportedly divided the money into plastic bags and distributed them among her entourage to avoid declaring the cash at customs, as required by law for amounts over $10,000.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, Miller pleaded guilty to the charges of bankruptcy fraud and bringing unreported money into the country. Her sentencing took place in May 2017, where she received a sentence of one year and one day in federal prison, followed by two years of supervised release. She was also fined $40,000 and ordered to pay a $120,000 judgment.</p><p style=text-align:left>Miller was initially sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison, which translates to 366 days. However, she spent eight months in prison before being released early. Miller's early release was due to health complications that required urgent medical attention.</p><p>Miller served her time in a California prison. The early termination of her sentence allowed her to address her health issues outside of the prison system, which later revealed to be a diagnosis of cancer, specifically non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Miller had emergency spinal surgery not long after her release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aZkpfGbrjEnmSmoZyhsrN5xqhkraddn66quA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-michael-sheen-is-a-not-for-profit-actor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Michael Sheen Is a Not-for-Profit Actor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tony-balestreri-bio-age-family-married-food-stars.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Chef Tony Balestreri?
