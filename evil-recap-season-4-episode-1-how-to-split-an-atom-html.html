data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwipo7h6000i0ihhr6s65tus@published data-word-count=101>Evil&nbsp;friends, what a bittersweet way to kick off a new season. As I’m sure you’ve heard, as I’m sure you’ve screamed to the heavens (or to hell, you do you), we are embarking upon&nbsp;Evil’s fourth and&nbsp;final&nbsp;season. The one silver lining I keep&nbsp;in my head&nbsp;is that, at the very least, knowing this is the last hoorah, Robert and Michelle King will&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;be&nbsp;going for broke. Not that they ever don’t. It’s why we love this show, right? Okay, never mind, this is the worst. Isn’t there a demon I can sell my soul to for a renewal or something? Netflix? (Just kidding.) (Or not.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy7us00103b6xcx8789y8@published data-word-count=197>Unsurprisingly, we’re starting the season with a bang. And I’m not even talking about that hilarious, oddly hot sex scene with Kristen and Andy in the Bouchard kitchen. But also I guess I’m&nbsp;not&nbsp;not&nbsp;talking about&nbsp;that?&nbsp;The horniest knife work I’ve ever seen! But really, we should kick things off where the show does, with that glorious opening scene in which Kristen takes in the news that Leland has hijacked her eggs and tossed in his sperm to create the Antichrist. This Antichrist will be born in 38 days, and Leland will raise him, and Kristen thinks that’s honestly just&nbsp;hilarious. No, seriously. As only Kristen Bouchard can, she laughs and laughs at the thought of Leland raising a child. “I can’t think of any greater torture than to give you a baby,” she says, thwarting his plans to get under her skin. “I giggle at the thought of you waking up at 3 a.m. because the Antichrist needs changing.” Oh, reader, I giggle too.&nbsp;Leland always feels a few steps ahead of Kristen and our merry band of assessors, so whenever she can get the better of him, even for a minute, it is delicious.&nbsp;Oh, it’s so good to be back.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy83r00113b6xkq7x7v8d@published data-word-count=88>After Kristen saunters out of that baby shower (what’s on the Antichrist’s registry?) laughing like a goddamn boss, she gets down to business. Sheryl, who of course has known this was Leland’s plan all along, is now banned from the Bouchard house and&nbsp;forbidden&nbsp;from seeing her granddaughters. I still can’t get a handle on what Sheryl’s endgame is here. Does she have one?&nbsp;Is she&nbsp;simply&nbsp;possessed and loving it?&nbsp;Is there any part of who she used to be before Leland set her bed on fire (literally, remember)? She remains a mystery.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy86o00123b6xxi7zfha0@published data-word-count=59>Kristen’s plan, though, is crystal clear: In her life, in her house, religion is out&nbsp;and&nbsp;science is in, baby. She’s not even entertaining the possibility of this stuff being real anymore. She wants things to go back to normal. No more demons and goblins and Antichrists, just hot kitchen sex and refusing to take her kids to Sunday Mass. Normal!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy89f00133b6xhm9nlgxc@published data-word-count=63>She carries this new outlook to her work, too. The gang&nbsp;is summoned&nbsp;to St. Joseph’s for their next assignment with Father Ignatius.&nbsp;Thank God, this sweet man is back to make us laugh but&nbsp;also,&nbsp;mostly,&nbsp;to make us cry — a picture of Monsignor Korecki up on the wall in his office?&nbsp;Be still my heart.&nbsp;Ignatius is&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;just&nbsp;filling in until the Vatican sends someone else, but&nbsp;come on,&nbsp;we need him.&nbsp;We&nbsp;deserve&nbsp;him.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy8c800143b6xv73lst0o@published data-word-count=113>He hands them our case of the week: People are protesting a particle-accelerator lab called the Garrow Research Facility, claiming it could open the gates to hell, and the scientists there have requested that our trio investigate to prove those protesters wrong. At the facility, the scientists, led by a physicist named Ethan, don’t help their cause — they’re super-shady, especially when the team starts asking about the whereabouts of a woman who used to work there and was part of a viral video of people performing a blood sacrifice at the lab. In the video, they stab her; it looks super-fake, but their excuses for why she isn’t around also sound super-fake.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy8f000153b6xmws2ft5x@published data-word-count=54>Nothing’s adding up, and when David heads back to his little electric scooter — because&nbsp;Evil&nbsp;can find ways to make anything, even checking out a particle-accelerator&nbsp;facilty, just a bit extra kooky — one of the custodial workers, Mateo, has left him a note that says “They’re lying” with a time and place to meet him.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy8r800163b6x8um593gy@published data-word-count=70>And so they meet. Mateo tells the whole story: When&nbsp;they were&nbsp;building the accelerator, they came across a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;sinkhole&nbsp;miles&nbsp;and miles deep; instead of trying to fill it, they cemented over it — but something’s down there.&nbsp;Mateo has his&nbsp;own&nbsp;video, in which smoke starts to fill the accelerator loop&nbsp;and&nbsp;some&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;creature&nbsp;is obscured&nbsp;by it — a&nbsp;big&nbsp;creature.&nbsp;We see only its outline, but it’s enough to be like, Yeah, sure, that could come from the depths of hell.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy8u900173b6x0l7xv8o6@published data-word-count=81>Well, for us it is —&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;not enough for new skeptic-on-steroids Kristen. Back in the car, she immediately asks Ben to debunk it, something she requests him to&nbsp;do&nbsp;immediately, and he shows her a video he made using some app that can insert “angels” into videos. Mateo’s video could easily be a fake.&nbsp;The way Katja Herbers gleefully tells her&nbsp;friend,&nbsp;“It’s&nbsp;good news, David, there’s no monster coming out of&nbsp;hell,” should be studied in universities across this country.&nbsp;It is so good. Why are they&nbsp;canceling&nbsp;this show, again?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy8xg00183b6xk18i5ibj@published data-word-count=88>Things get more muddled when the crew finally meets with the new Vatican rep, Father La Russo. La Russo informs them that the Vatican isn’t&nbsp;actually&nbsp;worried about the gates of hell being opened but rather about the particle accelerator creating a chain of quantum black holes that could swallow the earth. Admittedly, that is much freakier than the gates of hell. Science is crazy, people.&nbsp;Ben&nbsp;is of the understanding&nbsp;that something like this&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;is nearly impossible, but La Russo wants more than just&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;impossible odds — back to the lab the team goes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy90n00193b6xejv62nfb@published data-word-count=80>This time, the trio splits up. David hops on his cute&nbsp;li’l scooter again and heads down to the section of the loop Mateo had directed them to. Once he’s left alone, weird things start happening. Mainly, he watches as a giant monster bug demon thing comes slithering out of the hole with the woman from the video’s head on it&nbsp;and&nbsp;she’s still whispering for help. Maybe I take back the thing about the black holes being freakier — it’s a tie.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy93k001a3b6xr9y88cf9@published data-word-count=93>Kristen and Ben go with Ethan to check out all the&nbsp;safety protocols the lab has&nbsp;to prevent black holes from swallowing the earth.&nbsp;(God, I missed the insane sentences doing&nbsp;Evil&nbsp;recaps allows me to write.) Everything looks normal and up to code, but then Ethan invites them both to&nbsp;actually&nbsp;step into the accelerator, which, like, I know nothing about quantum physics, but I&nbsp;do know not to hop into a particle accelerator. Especially one that may or may not be related to the gates of hell.&nbsp;You know my&nbsp;girl Kristen is an immediate “no” when Ethan makes the offer.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy96q001b3b6xbqxkm42r@published data-word-count=148>You can probably guess that things go&nbsp;terribly&nbsp;wrong: The accelerator starts up — later, they blame it on a test run, but come on, that thing turned on&nbsp;by&nbsp;itself! — and an ion beam&nbsp;…&nbsp;well, I don’t know how to tell you this exactly, but Ben takes an ion beam directly to the face. At the exact moment it happens, he sees flashes of some weird&nbsp;shit&nbsp;but gets a clean bill of health from several doctors. That sounds all well and good, but then Ben goes home and has a wild vision/hallucination/actual sighting of yet another giant buglike demon. Are all our demons this season going to be bug-esque? I miss Ben’s&nbsp;freaky-deaky&nbsp;horny night ghost, but this development is interesting. For some reason, he doesn’t fill in his buddies on this post-ion-beam occurrence,&nbsp;and that&nbsp;is frustrating. Why do these people who have seen the&nbsp;absolute&nbsp;weirdest shit together not trust one another when the unexplainable happens.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy9m5001c3b6xoot5q0hs@published data-word-count=87>David does the same thing: He lies to Ben and Kristen about his experience with the sinkhole at B33. Instead, he confides in Sister Andrea.&nbsp;Yeah, she’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;real&nbsp;one, but so are Ben and Kristen.&nbsp;Everyone needs all of the information! I am concerned! During his visit with Sister Andrea, David also informs her of another vision he had, of an angel telling&nbsp;him,&nbsp;“Woe to Babylon in 38 days.”&nbsp;Sounds like a prophecy about the end of the world.&nbsp;And no, you’re not wrong: We’ve heard about something else happening in 38 days too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy9m6001d3b6xe4th7uy4@published data-word-count=161>The gang heads back to the particle accelerator one last time, and in true Evil fashion, something wild happens with no concrete answer. On security cameras, they watch as Mateo, who has&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;copped to blackmailing the facility and making up all of those videos (yeah, right), heads over to the sinkhole.&nbsp;It looks as though he&nbsp;might jump in, but the sinkhole isn’t fully visible in the shot.&nbsp;We see his arms swinging around,&nbsp;we&nbsp;see him moving around in the bottom of the frame, but who can tell what’s happening&nbsp;here?&nbsp;Then he’s gone. When they run over to check out the&nbsp;hole&nbsp;situation and the whole situation, Mateo is still gone, noises like his screaming are coming up from the bowels of the earth, and there’s blood and&nbsp;huge&nbsp;scratch marks on the outer edge of the sinkhole. Are they from Mateo’s trying to hold on for dear life, or are they from a giant bug monster demon dragging him to&nbsp;the depths of&nbsp;hell? Is it weird that the latter&nbsp;actually&nbsp;seems more plausible?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy9p6001e3b6xigrku98k@published data-word-count=55>Back at St. Joseph’s, they tell La Russo and Ignatius that&nbsp;their&nbsp;findings are inconclusive. However, if they are really looking for a reason to shut the place down, its safety codes are not totally up to snuff. La Russo wonders if they can do so before the particle accelerator is officially opened … in 38 days.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy9sf001f3b6xyroicin9@published data-word-count=73>Thankfully, David doesn’t keep everything to himself any longer. His friends clock his strange reaction to that number and, once they’re alone, ask him to spill. He had a dream, he says, about a warning that the world would end in 38 days with the birth of the Antichrist. Once again, Kristen cannot hold in her laughter. “I’m having a son in 38 days,” she tells them. Things are about to get wild.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmy9vo001g3b6xd71q2ikm@published data-word-count=103>Actually,&nbsp;things are already wild. While all of this particle-accelerator stuff is happening, something even stranger is&nbsp;going on&nbsp;right under Kristen’s nose. Remember how Leland and Sheryl kidnapped Andy and kept him catatonic in his closet? Remember that?&nbsp;Well,&nbsp;Andy gets a phone call from Leland, and good ol’ Lee plays him that version of “Feliz Navidad” we’ve heard coming from Leland’s toy.&nbsp;Andy is suddenly in a trance. Yes, he knows where he’s supposed to go, he tells Leland before hanging up and leaving his house.&nbsp;“Feliz Navidad” is a trigger for whatever&nbsp;the hell&nbsp;they did to Andy,&nbsp;and&nbsp;while I like the guy and want&nbsp;the best&nbsp;for him, that’s just hilarious.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmya8y001h3b6x741j0k70@published data-word-count=104>Later, we find him back on that meat slab in the closet, fully catatonic again, with both Leland and Sheryl trying to brainwash him for their&nbsp;own&nbsp;benefit. Leland repeats, “Why is your wife fucking a priest?” to attempt to sow discord in their marriage, and Sheryl repeats, “You need Sheryl back in the house,” because, well, you can figure that one out.&nbsp;I hope&nbsp;at some point&nbsp;their&nbsp;commands start to get crossed&nbsp;and&nbsp;it leads to chaos.&nbsp;But, like, the fun kind. Not this kind, in which Andy shows up at the rectory and wants to start a fight with David for fucking his wife. I don’t&nbsp;want&nbsp;Kristen’s boys fighting like this!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmyac7001i3b6xwt30b5ss@published data-word-count=79>David immediately calls Kristen to&nbsp;have a little check-in&nbsp;on their friendship in light of this accusation, which&nbsp;honestly&nbsp;is adorable.&nbsp;The cute part doesn’t last long because once David finally tells her why he’s worried that the two of them aren’t good anymore, she gets pissed. “Do I have feelings for you? Yeah! But my husband needs to shut the fuck up!” she yells before marching home, chugging a canned margarita and spitting some of it at a picture of her and Andy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmyafc001j3b6x7atsfd8r@published data-word-count=50>The&nbsp;next morning, she confronts him, and he&nbsp;continues to press&nbsp;her on how far she and David have gone. She tells him to shape up or ship out. In short, Leland’s plan works spectacularly. Now, we’ll have to wait and see&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;what he wants&nbsp;out of&nbsp;this and how far he’ll go to get it.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clwjmy7ua000z3b6xzmzxzs06@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text><strong>The Church Bulletin</strong></span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmyaig001k3b6xkuxx7enw@published data-word-count=12>• Evil’s opening credits remain the best in the biz,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it isn’t&nbsp;even close.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clwjmyalf001l3b6xx9xlaage@published data-word-count=56>• Sister Andrea may be the busiest nun in New York.
