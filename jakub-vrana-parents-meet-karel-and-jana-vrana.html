Vránahas a step-sister named Jana Krizova whom he spends a lot of time with during family hangouts.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><a href=#>READ ALSO: Jakub Vrána Children: Does Jakub Vrána Have Kids?</a></h4><p>Vrána stands at a height of 1.83 m tall and weighs 89kg. He learned to skate in a facility run by Vojtech Kucera’s brother, a former Capitals scout, before leaving home at the age of 15 to play in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL).</p><p>In 2009, Vrána participated in the Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with his Chomutov minor ice hockey squad.</p><p>During the 2012–13 season, Vrána made his Elitserien debut while playing for Linköping HC. Vrána became the ninth-youngest player overall and the league’s youngest foreign player upon making his Elitserien debut in October 2012.</p><p>He then divided his time between Linkoping’s junior and senior squads the following season. In 24 games with the senior team, Vrána scored three points and accrued two penalty minutes. In 24 games with the youth team, he scored 25 points.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Vrána was ranked fourth among European skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau at the end of the 2013–14 campaign.</p><p>The Washington Capitals eventually selected Vrána in the first round of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, 13th overall. Vrána attended the Capitals development camp after the 2014 draft and signed a three-year, entry-level contract.</p><p>After that, Vrána spent the whole 2014–15 season in Sweden before appearing in three regular-season games for the Capitals’ American Hockey League (AHL) club, the Hershey Bears.</p><p>The 2015–16 NFL season marked Vrána’s first full professional season in North America with the Bears. Prior to sustaining a wrist injury, he played six games with the Bears and recorded two goals and four assists.</p><p>Vrána worked on gaining weight throughout the 2016 summer and arrived at the Capitals development camp 10 pounds heavier. Vrána started his second season in North America with the Hershey Bears once more, but on November 29, 2016, he was called up to the NHL for the first time.</p><p>He had 18 games under his belt and 16 points, good for third in the league in goals at the time of the recall. He then played against the New York Islanders on December 1 in his first NHL game, skating with Evgeny Kuznetsov and Andre Burakovsky on the Capitals’ second line.</p><p>A few games later, on December 9, 2016, Vrána scored his first NHL goal in a 4-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. On December 13 against the Islanders, Vrána recorded his first game with two assists and a point total.</p><p>On January 1st, 2017, he was reassigned to the Bears after accruing three points in 12 games. The following month, Vrána was recalled once more but was given a new assignment without taking part in any games. But on February 17, Vrána and Zach Sanford were brought up to the NHL level due to injuries in the Capitals’ starting lineup.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Vrána was on the roster for the Capitals’ season-opening game in 2017–18. With 13 goals and 14 assists in 73 games, his debut season was dubbed a “roller-coaster.”</p><p>On April 29, 2018, Vrána scored his first goal in a Stanley Cup playoff game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Capitals would go on to upset the Penguins in six games before defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games to win the Eastern Conference.</p><p>In game five of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Vegas Golden Knights, he scored the game’s first goal, giving the Capitals the victory. Vrána contributed to the Capitals’ first Stanley Cup victory by finishing the postseason with 8 points in 23 games.</p><p>Vrána achieved career highs in goals, assists, and points during the 2018–19 campaign. He also finished third on the club in goals. In addition, he became the 15th player in the history of the team to score at least 24 goals in a season before turning 24.</p><p>In exchange for Anthony Mantha, Vrána was transferred to the Detroit Red Wings on April 12, 2021, along with Richard Pánik, a 2021 first-round selection, and a 2022 second-round pick. In his first 11 games after joining the squad, Vrána tied multiple franchise records while scoring 11 points.</p><p>On April 22, Vrána made hockey history by becoming the second player ever to achieve a hat trick in his first four games with the Red Wings and the 26th player in Red Wings history to record four or more goals in a game against the Dallas Stars. Vrána and the Red Wings agreed to a three-year, $16.25 million contract on August 10, 2021.</p><p>Vrána suffered an injury during the first 10 minutes of the Red Wings’ practice after the signing, and his recovery time was projected to be three to four months. Due to an injury, Vrána only participated in 26 games during the 2021–22 season, but he still scored 13 goals and provided 6 assists. Vrána was enrolled in the NHL’s “Player Assistance Program” on October 19, 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Jakub Vrána’s parents?</h2><p>Vrána was born to Jana Vrána and Karel Vrána.&nbsp; His father was a poet, essayist, philosopher, professor, theologist, university educator and roman catholic priest</p><p>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOYpK2SYsOzrc2aZKmZopq7tb%2BMppyerF2grrOxy2aYp5xdn66vrYyvqZqmkWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-tolan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Tolan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kenny-smith.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kenny Smith: The Jet Who Soared in Basketball and Broadcasting</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
