Veeck was at various times the owner of the Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Browns and Chicago White Sox. As owner and team president of the Indians in 1947, Veeck signed Larry Doby and thus successfully integrated the American League. Veeck was the last owner to purchase a baseball franchise without an independent fortune, and is responsible for many innovations and contributions to baseball.Finding it hard to financially compete, Veeck retired after the 1980 Chicago White Sox season. He died of cancer six years later. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame five years later in 1991. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 9, 1914</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>1986-01-02</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chicago, Illinois, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Baseball executive</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Bill Veeck, Veeck, Bill</td></tr><tr><td>Star Sign</td><td>Aquarius</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=22.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Sometimes the best trades are the ones you never make.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>We can't always guarantee the ball game is going to be good; but we can guarantee the fan will have fun."</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>3</td><td>It isn't the high price of stars that is expensive, it's the high price of mediocrity.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>4</td><td>The Mets achieved total incompetence in a single year, while the Browns worked industriously for almost a decade to gain equal proficiency.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>5</td><td>I was in the game for love.
