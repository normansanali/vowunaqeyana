He used to tell me he wanted to marry me. Anything I ever wanted in life, he would make sure it came true.”</p><p>Before <a href=#>dying by suicide</a> in April 2017, Hernandez turned to Kennedy for support while in prison for the murder of his friend Odin Lloyd. The former New England Patriots player was set to serve a life sentence, but took his own life in his prison cell before his sentence was complete.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-Hernandez-Jailhouse-Lover-Kyle-Kennedy-Interview-4.jpg><p>“We would lock in to either cook food or smoke, get high, listen to music, just chill when we didn’t want to be around other people, I had never done anything like this before,” Kennedy said of his former lover. “We used to write letters back and forth to each other all day.”</p><p>The pair’s relationship <a href=#>quickly became sexual</a>, with Kennedy claiming that they would be physical with one another “once or twice a week.” During their time together in jail, he noticed Hernandez growing more and more “paranoid” about his future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-Hernandez-Jailhouse-Lover-Kyle-Kennedy-Interview-3.jpg><p>“He was more worried about if he was going to go home or not,” Kennedy explained. “He did whatever he had to do or if he ever felt disrespected or someone ever disrespected his people or someone he cared for, he would act on it.”</p><p>Hernandez was arrested in June 2013, less than one year after welcoming daughter Avielle with his fiancée, <a href=#><strong>Shayanna Jenkins</strong></a>. According to TMZ, the late athlete <a href=#>left a note for Jenkins</a> before his death.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-Hernandez-Jailhouse-Lover-Kyle-Kennedy-Interview.jpg><p>“You have always been my soulmate and I want you to love life and know I’m always with you. I love you so much and know you are an angel,” Hernandez reportedly wrote in 2017.</p><p>Aaron Hernandez: Jailhouse Lover Tells All premieres on REELZ Sunday, July 5, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJiaqp%2Bjeqmx0aeYp5yVr8ButsCio6GnpaiybrjOr5yrZZSawaK1y6xkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXZ67brrEsGSdp5Nk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aneurin-barnard-is-portrayed-as-a-daniel-solace-in-a-suspense-horror-series-1899-489541-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aneurin Barnard Is Portrayed As A Daniel Solace In A Suspense Horror Series 1899</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./friday-night-lights-director-didnt-know-tim-mcgraw-auditioned-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Friday Night Lights' Director Didn't Know Who Tim McGraw Was When He Auditioned</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
