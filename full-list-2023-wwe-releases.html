After WWE and UFC came together to form TKO Group Holdings, it sounded like maybe the cutbacks would be limited to office staff only.

Now with the year coming to an end, it is time to take note of every wrestler who was released from their contract (talent that asked to leave or outright quit won't be mentioned). Here are all the names that were released from their WWE and NXT contracts in 2023.</p><h2 id=dolph-ziggler-was-going-to-be-the-next-shawn-michaels>Dolph Ziggler Was Going To Be The Next Shawn Michaels</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2004-2023>WWE Tenure: 2004-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>43</p></td><td><p>Triple Crown Champion, NXT Champion, Money In The Bank Winner</p></td><td><p>Vs.

This might have been the biggest shocker on Thursday. His resume boasts over 1500 matches and includes 685 wins in WWE and 38 PPV wins. He was a 2x World Heavyweight Champion, 1x NXT Champion, 6x Intercontinental Champion, 2x US Champion, and a 4x Tag Champion.</p><p>It was a nearly two-decade career with WWE, and he will go down as one of the best in-ring workers of this generation. To some, he was the "next Shawn Michaels". He seemed destined to be among the top guys in WWE and was a fan favorite, win or lose, could have been featured anywhere on the card and have been believable.</p><h2 id=shelton-benjamin-was-among-the-greats-from-ohio-valley-wrestling>Shelton Benjamin Was Among the Greats From Ohio Valley Wrestling</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-for-this-term-2017-2023>WWE Tenure For This Term: 2017-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>48</p></td><td><p>United States Champion, Intercontinental Champion, Raw Tag Team Champion</p></td><td><p>Vs. The Viking Raiders, Main Event (09/11/23)</p></td></tr></table><p>Like Ziggler, Benjamin had an impressive resume. He posted 289 wins in WWE, with 41 PPV wins. He was a 3x Intercontinental Champion, 1x US Champion, 3x 24/7 Champion, 3x Tag Champion, and most recently, part of the now defunct Hurt Business faction.</p><p>Seen as one of the most gifted athletes in a group of OVW graduates that included Brock Lesnar, John Cena, and Batista, Benjamin had a great career, even if he never reached their levels of stardom. Benjamin confirmed his release on social media shortly after it was announced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elias-finally-quot-drifted-quot-away-from-wwe>Elias Finally "Drifted" Away From WWE</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2014-2023>WWE Tenure: 2014-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>36</p></td><td><p>24/7 Champion</p></td><td><p>Intercontinental #1 Contender Battle Royal, Raw (05/15/23)</p></td></tr></table><p>Known for some time as The Drifter from NXT, Elias became quite popular as a heel and then WWE tried to turn him into a babyface musician, even releasing songs that were put out on iTunes. He lost a lot of momentum and was taken off of programming for some time. He returned as Ezekiel (Elias' brother), and that took off thanks to some help from Kevin Owens. But, it didn't last as he was repackaged again as Elias and then drifted away (pun intended).</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/5-times-a-wwe-release-hurt-a-wrestler-s-career-5-times-it-helped-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>5 Times A WWE Release Hurt A Wrestler's Career (& 5 Times It Helped)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While no one likes to get fired, some WWE releases have helped wrestlers completely reinvent their careers elsewhere.</span><p>WWE was never able to get his career back on track and rumors spread in early September that he was likely done with the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-39-s-departure-was-awkward>Emma's Departure Was Awkward</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-for-this-term-2022-2023>WWE Tenure For This Term: 2022-2023</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/emma-wwe.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>34</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>Vs.

She had just posted a promotional tweet for WWE's return to Australia when she learned that she wouldn't be joining them on the trip because she'd been fired. She posted a follow-up tweet saying, "Oops nevermind. I just got released… I am no longer with WWE."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emma had been released before and was brought back by Triple H. Her return didn't amount to much, eventually becoming the manager for real-life finance Riddick Moss, who was also released. Moss was a talented and strong performer who had a solid run with Baron Corbin, but when he split and was no longer Madcap Moss, there wasn't much for him creatively.</p><h2 id=mustafa-ali-was-in-the-middle-of-a-nxtfeud>Mustafa Ali Was In The Middle Of A NXTFeud</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2016-2023>WWE Tenure: 2016-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>37</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>Vs.

He wrote, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I am longer working with WWE. I look forward to the future. Thank you."</a> It isn't clear if this was a mutual decision or a release as Ali has had public issues with the way he'd been used in the past by WWE, having previously requested his release and it not being granted.</p><p>Considered one of the better in-ring talents, Ali was all over the place with his gimmicks and characters, sometimes getting pushed and other times disappearing for weeks if not months.</p><h2 id=rick-boogs-could-shred-on-a-guitar>Rick Boogs Could Shred On A Guitar</h2><h3 id=wwe-tenure-2017-2023>WWE Tenure: 2017-2023</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Age</p></th><th scope=col><p>Accolade(s)</p></th><th scope=col><p>Final Match</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>35</p></td><td><p>24/7 Champion</p></td><td><p>Slim Jim Battle Royal, SummerSlam 2023</p></td></tr></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several fans felt bad for Rick Boogs when his name was announced among those released.

The outspoken big man, he was viewed by many as the least-capable wrestler of the bunch, making front page news and becoming the brunt of jokes by the announce crew when he famously tried to dive over the top rope and got all of two inches off the ground.
