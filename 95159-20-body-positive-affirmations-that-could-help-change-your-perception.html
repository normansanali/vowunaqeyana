Saying <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>body positive affirmations </a>to yourself is one of the best and can help to transform your thoughts and feelings about your body and make you believe what you're saying. In case you're unfamiliar with <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>what affirmations are</a>, they're statements that you make in an attempt to change your unconscious thought process and reasoning. These statements are bold and full of power that help to shift your thinking in a different direction.</p><p>According to Boulder Academy Lifestyle Coaching, studies have shown that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>people have an average of 45,000 to 51,000 thoughts</a> <i>per day<b>. </b></i>Eighty percent of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>your thoughts are negative,</a> if you fall into the average, and a majority of these happen on an unconscious level.</p><p>Affirmations bring out the negative, unconscious thoughts you have about yourself into the open. It forces you to be aware of your thought process and confront your inner demons that you probably usually ignore. "When you start making conscious positive thoughts, you actually<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> become more aware of the negative thoughts</a> that are always threatening to take over," Scott Armstrong of the Boulder Coaching Academy said..</p><p>If you want to start<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> bringing affirmations into your life</a>, it's often recommended to set aside a certain time of day to do them and incorporate them into your routines. Since this process can bring to the surface a lot of stuff that you probably don't want to deal with, it can be very hard to persevere. But the further you go, the easier it gets, and the more you start to shift your internal processes. No one said that change was easy.
