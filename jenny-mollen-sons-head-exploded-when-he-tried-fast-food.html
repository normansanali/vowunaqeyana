I’ve always been sort of a stickler about healthy food, but halfway through <a href=#>quarantine</a> … I was like, ‘How would you like to try something called fast food?’ And my son’s head exploded.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jenny-Mollen-Fast-Food-All-White.jpg><p>According to Mollen, Sid was seriously impressed by the new fare — and the perks that come with it. “He’s like, ‘Wait, are you kidding? Hold on, hold on. A toy comes with it?'” she recalled.</p><p>Though the Arizona native has earned quite the reputation for crafting <a href=#>photogenic school lunches for her boys</a>, she’s obviously taken a break from that in quarantine. “I don’t have time to get creative because it’s already onto the next meal,” she told Us. “My kids, like, want a feeding every 15 minutes so I haven’t been doing a lot of, like, building towers out of French toast or anything like that.”</p><p>Still, despite the occasional fast food binge, the My Best Friend’s Girl actress said she’s doing her best to sneak some healthy foods into her kids’ eating regimens. “I am trying to make sure I incorporate a lot of fruits and vegetables into their diet and am keeping it fun and interesting,” she explained. “I think [children] should eat what you eat, but I do think it’s fun to, like, make it compelling by telling a story with it. So I’ve been doing a little bit of that, but really I am just trying to survive!”</p><p>Mollen added: “It’s been a real experience.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After months of being cooped up inside with Biggs, 42, and their kids, the Live Fast Die Hot author is ready to start safely venturing out a bit more, in part by working with Allergan Aesthetics on the Look Forward campaign. The initiative encourages people to treat themselves to in-office aesthetic treatments while returning safely to their routines amid the pandemic.</p><p>“[It’s] all about stepping back into real life,” she said. “Getting out of the <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a>, going to see your derm for a little bit of BOTOX Cosmetic and leaving those pesky frown lines in quarantine.”</p><p>With reporting by Marc Lupo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqOdnqPGbrnOpaOepl2ovK%2B%2FjKGcmpxdmsWxuM6dnJ1lp52yr3nHnmStqpmasW6ywKyrZp6fpLFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./karan-bhola-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-596986-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Karan Bhola Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./intel-details-10th-gen-comet-lake-h-for-45-w-notebooks-up-to-53-ghz.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Intel Details 10th Gen Comet Lake-H for 45 W Notebooks: Up to 5.3 GHz*</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
