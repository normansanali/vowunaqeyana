She started philanthropy in 2023 to further her initiative toward society.</p><p>She has partnered with the “Adopt Don’t Shop” effort to help close down pet shops across Colorado and urge people to adopt stray dogs as part of her social responsibility endeavors.</p><p>From 1983 through 1998, her retired husband John Elway played professionally for the Denver Broncos exclusively and even won two Super Bowls.</p><p>He served as an executive after retiring and has been a consultant for the Denver Broncos since 2022. He has made sizable charitable contributions to the Colorado area as well.</p><p>John and Paige have been dating for more than 15 years. The pair got engaged in 2008 after a year of dating, and they were wed on August 29, 2009.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Childhood, family, and education</h2><p>Social activist and former cheerleader Paige Green was of white heritage and was born on January 2, 1967.</p><p>She was raised in Denver, Colorado, but was born in Seattle, Washington, in the United States.</p><p>Capricorn by astrological sign, Paige Green is 56 years old.

However, their relationship was short-lived.</p><p>Eventually, she fell in love with John Elway, an NFL player who is now her husband.</p><p>Although though she and Elway had first met in 2005 at Marcus Allen’s golf tournament in Los Angeles, their relationship wouldn’t start up until much later.</p><p>In September 2008, John, a former quarterback for the Broncos, proposed to Paige Green while they were on vacation in Venice, Italy.</p><p>On August 29, 2009, the pair exchanged vows in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. Craig Andrisen, Tim Schmidt, and sportswriter Rick Reilly were among the attendees.</p><p>In addition to playing football, Elway is one of Denver’s most well-known benefactors. In fact, at the Carousel Ball for the Children’s Diabetes Foundation in October 2015, he received a Tribute Award in his honor.</p><p>Even though Paige and John have been married for more than 7 years, there is no information on their children.</p><p>Although divorcing Janet Elway in 2003, John Elway wed her in 1984.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Salary, Net Worth, and Career Earnings</h2><p>Paige joined the Oakland Raiders’ cheerleaders as a team promotion.</p><p>She must have made that much per year because Oakland cheerleaders make, on average, $75,000 per year.</p><p>She has other unspecified sources of income in other industries, nevertheless.</p><p>Over the course of her career, Paige Green has earned a respectable sum of money. As of 2023, she has a net worth of about $1 million.</p><p>In contrast, her husband John Elway, who earns $3 million a year in salary, has a net worth of around $145 million.</p><p>As a quarterback for the Broncos, he made over $25 million in pay, with $45 million in total earnings over 16 seasons.</p><p>He has the most costly collection of automobiles in the world, which includes a Mercedes-Benz S55AMG.</p><p>The couple is content in their enormous, seven-bedroom Englewood home, which is worth $5.81 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Husband Ernie Elway</h2><p>John Elway, the spouse of Paige Green, is a well-known former American football player who competed for the Denver Broncos and won two Super Bowls (1998 and 1999).</p><p>At Stanford University, John played football and baseball and was a part of the fraternity Delta Tau Delta.</p><p>He was taken in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Colts, although he was later traded to the Denver Broncos.</p><p>Elway had one of the best winning percentages in NFL history and was recognized as one of the best quarterbacks.</p><p>Additionally, he has 148 victories to his name, built a stellar resume over the course of his career, and had an immense influence on football.</p><p>Elway served as general manager from 2011 until 2020 after retiring in 1998.</p><p>After that, he started serving as a consultant with the Denver Broncos in 2022 and makes a positive impact on society.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq2fnmWcnrOmedKtpquxXaSzbrbOoaVmnZysrrp5waKmoKqRpbW6ec2eq2avn6fBqXnMqKmeZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./titanic-return-netflix-after-oceangate-tragedy-divides-fans.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Titanic's return to Netflix after OceanGate submarine tragedy seriously divides fans</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-best-enid-sinclair-halloween-costume-ideas.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The best Enid Sinclair Halloween costume ideas</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
