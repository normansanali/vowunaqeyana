As the founder of L Brands Inc., which once included iconic brands such as Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, Wexner has built a legacy in the retail industry. As we approach 2024, there is growing interest in the net worth of this business magnate, philanthropist, and once the longest-serving CEO of a Fortune 500 company.</p><h3 id=les-wexners-financial-overview-ZBZEAIRqvY>Les Wexner’s Financial Overview</h3><table><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Detail</th></tr><tr><td>Estimated Net Worth:</td><td>$5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Age:</td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td>Born:</td><td>September 8, 1937</td></tr><tr><td>Country of Origin:</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Source of Wealth:</td><td>Retail, Investments</td></tr></table><h2 id=the-genesis-of-wexners-wealth-ZBZEAIRqvY>The Genesis of Wexner’s Wealth</h2><p>Les Wexner’s journey to financial success began with a single clothing store in Columbus, Ohio, called The Limited. The store, which opened in 1963, was funded by a $5,000 loan from his aunt. Wexner’s keen sense of the market and understanding of consumer needs led to the rapid expansion of The Limited, and subsequently, the creation of L Brands.</p><h3 id=expansion-and-diversification-ZBZEAIRqvY>Expansion and Diversification</h3><p>Wexner’s strategy was to focus on specialty stores that catered to specific segments of the apparel market. This led to the acquisition and development of various other brands, including Victoria’s Secret, which he bought in 1982 and transformed into a global lingerie powerhouse.</p><h2 id=peak-valuation-and-recent-trends-ZBZEAIRqvY>Peak Valuation and Recent Trends</h2><p>At its peak, L Brands was a retail juggernaut, and Wexner’s net worth soared.

These shifts have impacted the valuation of Wexner’s holdings and, consequently, his net worth.</p><h3 id=challenges-in-the-retail-sector-ZBZEAIRqvY>Challenges in the Retail Sector</h3><p>The retail industry has faced significant headwinds, and Wexner’s empire has not been immune.
