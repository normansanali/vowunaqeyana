Who killed Floch Foster? Learn more below.</strong></p><p>Floch Foster is a well-written character, and if judged by modern standards and morals, he would be an absolutely horrible person. However, his growth as a person has been such a well-put story that Floch is one of the most beloved characters in the series.</p><p>Floch died for his beliefs, and honestly, his death was one of the most exhilarating and awe-inspiring moments.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-killed-floch-in-aot-death-cause-of-floch-forster></span>Who Killed Floch In AOT? Death Cause Of Floch Forster<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Floch Foster was shot by Gaby. He was trying to sink the boat with a Thunder Spear, but the shot made him plummet down to the ocean, badly injured.</p><p>In the anime, Floch’s death is action-packed close-up shots, fluid camera motion, and rapid change of pace. It all highlights the tension and the adrenaline of the fight and the climax with Floch’s death.</p><p>However, the death of Floch Foster focuses more on his character development. In the manga, Floch manages to hook his maneuvering gear to the boat, and he follows the group across the ocean to Odiha.</p><p>At his last breath, Floch drags himself onto the hangar. In front of Hange and Jean, Floch begs, not for his life, but his home.</p><p>Floch was a self-proclaimed coward, but his growth as a person and his belief of wanting to save his home couldn’t have been more real.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=floch-foster-on-wikipedia></span>Floch Foster On Wikipedia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Floch Foster has his history written in the official Attack On Titan Wikipedia. He was one the most well-written character in the series, ranking only after Eren and Reiner.</p><p>Floch was a former recruit of Survey Corps, and he was the only survivor of the battle except for Hange and Squad Levi.</p><p>He was a prominent Yeagrists, and he was the de-facto leader of the faction. He was a self-proclaimed coward, but he wasn’t afraid of death. He was scared of his death not being meaningful.</p><p>He believed Eren was the only one who could save the New Eldian Empire and a necessary evil.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=floch-foster-voice-actor-and-more></span>Floch Foster Voice Actor And More<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kensho Ono was the voice actor of Floch Foster in Japanese and Matt Shipman in the English dub.</p><p>He is of medium height with short and tousled blond hair. Floch’s height was 175 cm when he got introduced to us. Later, he grew to 180 cm from the time skip.</p><p>Floch Foster got introduced in season 3 of episode 11 called ‘Bystander.’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqstculnJ1llqG8pLSMoqVmmaSprqS3jKidZqyZqa6vv4yfmKerXaiupbDEp5ydZZanvK5506GcZpyVlsGpec6fZJ%2Bkn5i1brLOq6qtnaJk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./farmhouse-farro-salad.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Autumn Farmhouse Salad</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./when-we-should-use-linkedhashmap.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>When we should use LinkedHashMap?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
