He has an estimated net worth of $4 million. Best known as the lead singer of<strong>&nbsp;Panic! At the Disco</strong>, he has been active in the music industry since 2004.&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Born on 12th April 1987, the 30-year-old wrote the soundtrack of film starring <a href=#>Megan Fox</a>. <a href=#>He is currently married to wife</a> <a href=#>Sarah Orzechowski </a>and is recognized for his talent of playing numerous instruments like organ, bass, guitar, cello, drums, piano, and many other.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, we are going to share some information about the rock star's net worth, earnings, and others.&nbsp;</p><h2>Brendon&nbsp;Urie net worth and earnings</h2><p>As of 2018, Urie has an estimated net worth of $4 million. Majority of sources claim that his estimated net worth is $4 million, but others have different figures in mind. His net worth according to some sources ranges between $3 million to $8 million.&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Nonetheless, some reliable sources like Buzzfeed claim his net worth to be $4 million. Back in 2015, his net worth was $3.5 million and the growth of his value throughout the years seems very low.&nbsp;Similarly, he has an annual salary of $450,000 which is quite low for such a talented artist and fan's also agree with it.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, his income from his songs also seems to range somewhere between $100,000 to $300,000.&nbsp;</p><p>It is believed that his net worth is so low and is growing very slowly because he doesn't release new songs and albums very often.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Urie's primary source of income is his albums and songs. Likewise, he and his group Panic! At the Disco also earns a reasonable sum by making appearances in private events. According to PopBuzz, the group charges $100,000 to $150,000 for performing at private events.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to making a big pay cheque out of music, he still has a long way to go. So, it is safe to assume that in the near future, his net worth and earnings will increase drastically.&nbsp;</p><h2>Brendon&nbsp;Urie properties</h2><p>Back in 2014, Urie bought a house in Encino, which was worth $1.7 million. The traditional looking house covers $1,935 sq ft finished with dark hardwoods, window treatments, and vaulted ceilings. The home also features three bedrooms and three baths, private studio, swimming pool, and many others.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In 2016, he shared his home with fans during an interview with <strong>Rock Sound</strong>. With white interiors, a grand piano in the living room, the house looks beautiful. The singer did not shy out from sharing details about his house at all. He even gave a thorough tour of his studio which looks impressive.&nbsp;</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He openly shared the house and address of the house with his fans allowing them to send letter and gifts. However, in 2017, his limits were crossed when fans started visiting his home and started getting continuously harassed.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, he moved out from the house and made sure to share the information with his fans. He shared a message through his Twitter sharing that he felt unsafe in his own house and would not reveal details about his new house.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Farewell, old house. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/g4bxmW3pQF</a></p>— Brendon Urie (@brendonurie) <a href=#>February 25, 2017</a><p>Instead, he provided fans with a new address where they could send letter and gifts, but the address was very far from him. As of now, details about his new house are not known.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving on to his cars, there is not much information about the list of cars he owns, but he has been spotted driving a red Chevy Impala convertible numerous times.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Brendon Urie's red Chevy Impala convertible" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hellhoundmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Panic-At-The-Disco.jpg ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>But we are sure that he owns many other luxury cars and also, let's not forget his collection of musical instruments which surely cost hundred thousand of dollars.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FSrZirnJ%2Bie6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmaaopq7pbvNZqyroZViwG6t0maYZqWlqLaktcCnZKGho2K7psCMsKarrJhisqK%2BzaKloKtdlrulecKaqZ6domKutHnAZqSuq5mYtqK6</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-had-to-pretend-to-do-it-in-front-of-a-camera-with-an-audience-zendaya-shares-what-terrified-her-while-filming-challengers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I had to pretend to do it in front of a camera with an audience: Zendaya shares what terrif</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./801284-ferg-asap-name-new-release-mdmx-fans-react-hip-hop-news.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ferg Drops ASAP From His Name For New Release, &amp;quot;MDMX&amp;quot;: Fans React</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
