But roughly two months ago, according to Castillo, when she scanned the card at self-checkout, “employees rushed” to ask for her ID.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/iStock-458887889.jpg><p>“After confirming that it wasn’t her card, they later told her she can <a href=#>never go back</a> to that location again,” he said in his TikTok video.</p><p>In an emailed statement to FOX Business, a spokesperson for Costco Wholesale said, “Costco is able to keep our prices as&nbsp;low as possible because our membership fees help offset our operational expenses, making our membership fee and structure important to us.”</p><p>“Costco’s membership policy has not changed. We have always asked for membership cards at our registers at time of checkout,” the statement goes on.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>“Our membership policy states that our membership cards are not transferable and since expanding our self-service checkout, we’ve noticed that non-member shoppers have been using membership cards that do not belong to them,” the statement continued.</p><p>Costco’s statement says the company doesn’t believe it’s fair for non-members&nbsp;to receive the same benefits and pricing&nbsp;as members who pay an annual fee to receive&nbsp;shopping perks.</p><p>“As we already ask for&nbsp;the membership card at&nbsp;checkout, we are now asking&nbsp;to see their membership card with their photo at our self-service checkout registers,”&nbsp;Costco’s spokesperson elaborated. “If their membership card does not have a photo, then we ask for a photo ID.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/iStock-1210116631.jpg><p>TikTok commenters were divided on the issue, with some thinking Costco should make it easier to add authorized users to a card — even for an additional fee — while others said the wholesaler should extend memberships to&nbsp;an entire household.</p><p>A few TikTok commenters said they have successfully ordered from Costco without a membership through Instacart, albeit with marked-up prices.&nbsp;</p><p>Castillo told FOX Business that he and his family aren’t mad at Costco for enforcing its policy, but he thinks the retailer could do more to make its membership terms clear.</p><p>He has not revealed the exact location that his mother was allegedly banned from.</p><p>“My husband travels for business frequently and we usually just need a once-a-month <a href=#>Costco run for all</a> of our&nbsp;household essentials, food&nbsp;and toiletries,” Castillo’s mother, who requested her name be omitted, said in a statement provided to FOX Business.</p><p>“We should be able to share this membership since we both benefit from these&nbsp;products and share bills,” she added. “Sixty dollars every year is not a lot, but it will be for a lifetime.”</p><p>Castillo told FOX Business&nbsp;that Costco hasn’t tried to reach out to him after his video went viral, and he never expected the wholesaler to do so.</p><p>“I mean, after all, we were technically in the wrong,” he said. “They always had this policy; they are just actually enforcing it now. And it’s not like they just banned her on the&nbsp;spot the first time.”</p><p>“My mom&nbsp;was given a warning before, which I guess she forgot about,” Castillo added. “We don’t feel entitled at all or feel any animosity&nbsp;towards Costco, we love Costco.”</p><p>On <a href=#>Costco’s</a> frequently-asked-questions webpage titled, “What is the difference between each type of membership,” it states that each Costco membership “includes a free Household Card.”&nbsp;</p><p>Another FAQ webpage specifies that Gold Star (which Castillo’s dad allegedly has) and Executive memberships allow a maximum of two users.</p><p>It involves getting access to a Costco Shop Card, which is a members-only item that apparently functions the same way as a gift card.</p><p>The card reportedly provides&nbsp;<u>entry and checkout</u>&nbsp;at Costco Wholesale locations — whether you’re a member or not.</p><p>Despite apparent loopholes, Costco’s policy still states that non-members cannot purchase products at any Costco location.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bma2hfmK6ttcWoqaehkWK6orqMrJiyq12YvLTAwqhkm5meo7Kleceiqmaln6J6p7vRZqysoZ6ceqm10mabmpyjYrqmucGeqaygmaV6pK3RnWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-sabin-accuses-mustafa-ali-of-paying-for-x-division-title-shot.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Sabin Accuses Mustafa Ali of Paying For X-Division Title Shot</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bryana-holly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bryana Holly Bio, Age, Height, Married, Net Worth, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
