We don't live together but we agreed to move together soon. He has a 16yo daughter. I gotta be honest, she seems quite stubborn and her own dad struggles to get her to listen. I'm not close with her which is something I know I need to work on and I fo my best."</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><h2 class=split>'I was absolutely astonished, speechless even'</h2><p>She further details, "Her pranks make it difficult for me to maintain a good relationship with her. She loves to prank and her prank can be a lot sometimes though there's sometimes some humor there. I tried to laugh it off everytime she'd prank me but it's gotten too much lately. My final straw was on her dad's birthday. I came to spend the day and have celebrstory dinner. My future inlaws and relatives came as well. All went well until dinner. We were about to have dinner and once we walked into the dining table, I was stunned to see my underwear hanging on a hanger in the corner."</p><p>"My stepdaughter looked at me, smiled and said "of you forgot these last time you visited and I didn't want you to forget them again so I hung them here!". I was absolutely astonished, speechless even. Michael was shocked and my inlaws and other guests INCLUDING Michael's friends were staring at me in awkward silence. I felt so humiliated, especially when some of the men laughed. Next thing I knew, I yelled at her and was grabbing my stuff about to leave and Michael and his daughter telling me to calm down it was just a prank. I left immediately and turned my phone off."</p><p>Her fiance was not sympathetic to her feelings. "Mivhael left many texts and voice messages calling me "hypersensitive" and claiming I ruined his birthday by walking out over a prank. We argued later and he said his daughter is a teenager and it's what they do so my reaction was over the top and ruined the birthday for him and his family. I haven't spoken to him in days and he's expecting I visit to apologize for walking out and also yelling at his daughter. AITA? DID i overreact?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a4ba2d61-410c-490f-8fa4-985cdfeb4765.jpeg><h2 class=split>'Please don't marry into this family'</h2><p>Redditors called the woman NTA (Not The A**hole) in this situation and advised her to evaluate her relationship with her fiance. One user wrote, "Oh Dear NTA But is this the life you want? Cause this is what you are going to get. Mean stunts directed towards you in the name of pranks. Please don't marry in to this family. Your fiance will never have your back based on what you said here."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/036d701e-524b-46d0-8cae-adfa92f1851a.jpeg><p>Another user wrote, "She's not a prankster. She's a bully. And he's enabling her. Rethink this relationship. She isn't worth the effort. NTA. You reacted too late."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a642f9dc-0533-48ad-b4c1-bf6ea781c689.jpeg><p>A third user commented, "This is what your life will be. The daughter treating you poorly and her father telling you you're overreacting. No. Just no. Putting someone's underwear on display at a family gathering isn't appropriate, and your dude should have responded so. That he's blaming you tells me everything I need. DTMFA IMO. NTA. And do not apologise, ever, for responding as you have."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/d08537c0-e8b7-4cf9-8844-b45eeec237d5.jpeg><p>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
