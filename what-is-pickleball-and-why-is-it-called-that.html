It is played with a paddle and a plastic ball on a court that is smaller than a tennis court. Despite its popularity, many people wonder about the origins of the unusual name "<a href=#>pickleball</a>." In this article, we will explore the history of pickleball and shed light on the intriguing story behind its name.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1><a href=#>Pickleball</a> was invented by three friends - Joel Pritchard, Barney McCallum, and Bill Bell - in the summer of 1965. The trio was looking for a way to keep their families entertained during a weekend gathering on Bainbridge Island, Washington. With limited equipment, they improvised by using ping pong paddles, a perforated plastic ball, and a badminton court.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>As the game gained popularity among their friends and neighbors, the founders realized that it needed a name. According to Joel Pritchard's wife, Joan, the game was initially referred to as "Pritchard's Pickleball" as they would name activities after their dog, Pickles. However, Pickles was not actually part of the creation of the game, so the name was simply a playful coincidence.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another theory suggests that the name "<a href=#>pickleball</a>" was derived from the term "pickle boat." In rowing, a pickle boat is a crew made up of leftover rowers from other boats. Similarly, the game of pickleball borrowed elements from various sports, making it a "pickle" of different games.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Regardless of the exact origin, the name "<a href=#>pickleball</a>" stuck, and it became the official name of the game. It has since grown into a beloved sport played by millions of people worldwide.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Over the years, <a href=#>pickleball</a> has experienced a surge in popularity, particularly among older adults. Its smaller court size, slower pace, and lighter equipment make it a more accessible option for those who may find tennis or other high-impact sports challenging.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1><a href=#>Pickleball</a> is not only a fun recreational activity but also a competitive sport. It has its own governing body, the USA Pickleball Association (USAPA), which organizes tournaments and establishes rules to maintain the integrity of the game. The sport has even been included in the National Senior Games and many retirement communities across the United States have dedicated pickleball courts.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1><a href=#>Pickleball</a> is a unique and enjoyable sport that has captivated players of all ages. Its unusual name, derived from a playful coincidence or a rowing term, adds to its charm and intrigue. Whether you're a seasoned athlete or a beginner looking for a new hobby, pickleball offers a fun and engaging experience that brings people together on the court. So grab a paddle, find a court, and get ready to enjoy the exhilarating game of <a href=#>pickleball!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXZ7AbrzInKKlnZKWua15wKebZq%2BYrnqqv4yiq2abkaG5prCMrZ%2BarA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-joy-behar-host-is-missing-and-replaced-on-the-view.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Joy Behar?
