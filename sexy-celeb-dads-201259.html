Many Hollywood dads have given glimpses into their lives with their little ones, from <a href=#><strong>Thomas Rhett</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Travis Scott</strong></a>.</p><p>The country singer shares daughters Willa, Ada and Lennon with his wife, <strong>Lauren Akins</strong>. The Grammy nominee was “born to be a girl dad,” he <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly in October 2019</a>.</p><p>“I love it,” the Georgia native gushed at the time. “I love doing their hair, and I love playing the Barbies with them, whatever they want me to do, tea parties. It’s just been awesome to get to be a dad of two beautiful girls and a third one on the way.”</p><p>Akins noted that her husband was “learning” to style their daughters’ hair. “He’s doing it actually pretty well,” the Live in Love author told Us. “I’m impressed.”</p><p>The couple added that when they found out the sex of baby No. 3, they were shocked to learn that they didn’t have a boy on the way.</p><p>“Ninety percent of our family thought it was a boy,” the “Marry Me” singer explained to Us. “I thought for sure it was a boy. When I saw the pink smoke come out of that thing, I was just like, ‘Oh, my gosh.’”</p><p>As for Scott, the rapper <a href=#>welcomed</a> daughter <a href=#>Stormi</a> with on-again, off-again girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> in April 2018. The Texas native “is a very hands-on dad and engaged,” a source exclusively told Us the following year. “<a href=#>He spoils his daughter</a> rotten and absolutely loves her to death and would do anything to make her life the best that it can be.”</p><p>In December 2019, the Cactus Jack creator <a href=#>told XXL Magazine</a> that fatherhood was “better than what [he] thought it would be.”</p><p>Scott explained, “Stormi is one of the best human beings I know. She’s like my best friend. She makes life a little bit easier. She just inspires me and she surprises me every day with how she’s thinking. It’s so crazy.”</p><p>The “Sicko Mode” rapper called the toddler a “battery” that same year, explaining to GQ Germany that <a href=#>Stormi gives him “tremendous energy.”</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He gushed in October 2019: “[She] showed me so many things that I did not [get before]. Many things in life I only noticed when my daughter was born. [Fatherhood] is the most impressive thing that ever happened to me. Really.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see more celebrity dads spending time with their children over the years, from <a href=#><strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong> </a>to <a href=#><strong>Dwyane Wade</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwKbE2GaanqSVl3qlrcOsZGtoYWeCens%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-akons-net-worth-in-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Akon's Net Worth in 2024?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rondi-reed-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rondi Reed Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
