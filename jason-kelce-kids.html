After all, two Kelces have cemented themselves as <a href=#>NFL</a> legends over the past few years. <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> has long been considered one of the greatest tight ends in the history of American football and has multiple Super Bowl victories under his belt as part of the Kansas City Chiefs. <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a> boasts a similar reputation as a Super Bowl champion and a legendary center for the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>As with any athlete, though, the legend and career don't last forever. On March 5, 2024, Jason announced that he was formally retiring from the NFL. In an emotional press conference attended by his family, Jason expressed his desire to continue working in the NFL in some capacity. However, this was a decision that didn't come lightly, although his wife and kids have been at the front of his mind as he decided to make this announcement. Who are Jason's kids? Let's meet them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@jason.kelce</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jason Kelce has a sizeable family with three kids.</h2><p>Jason has been married to his wife, <a href=#>Kylie McDevitt</a>, since 2018. Incidentally, this was the same year that Jason and the Eagles won Super Bowl LII. Together, the two of them have three daughters. Their first Wyatt was born in 2019. Elliotte followed shortly after in 2021. Their third and youngest daughter, Bennett, was born in 2023.</p><p>Adorably enough, Jason's girls refer to Travis as "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncle Travvy</a>" and they typically root for their daddy over their uncle in football.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, Jason's family was at the forefront of his mind when it came to announcing his retirement. In his Prime documentary that debuted in 2023, Jason mentioned that his having played football for more than a decade had taken a toll on both his physical health and his family. During his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement</a> in 2024, he spoke out in loving support of his family as he choked back tears during the conference. Kylie was sitting in the front row along with Jason's parents and his brother Travis.</p><p>"[Kylie] has also given me three beautiful girls and a life that increasingly brings me more fulfillment off the field than it does on," Jason stated. "We've had a great run, Ky."</p><p>Coincidentally, his second daughter, Elliotte, celebrated her fourth birthday on the same day as Jason's retirement announcement.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Disney Parks (@disneyparks)</a></p></figure><p>As of this writing, it is unknown how Jason's career will shift as he steps away from a legendary football career. Jason and Travis have built a successful podcast, New Heights, over the past two NFL seasons. Whatever Jason ends up doing in retirement, he has made it clear that he has the love and support of his whole family to help him through this transition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660u81mop6kk5p6rLXDrA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./south-park-friends-jennifer-aniston-super-nervous-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Friends' Star Jennifer Aniston Was 'Super Nervous' to Guest Star as a Voice Actor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-definition-of-lay-investiture.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is the definition of lay investiture</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
