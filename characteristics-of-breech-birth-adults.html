class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Although most <b>breech babies</b> are born healthy, they <b>do have</b> a slightly higher risk for certain <b>problems</b> than <b>babies</b> in the normal position <b>do</b>. Most of these <b>problems</b> are detected by 20 week ultrasounds. So if nothing <b>has</b> been identified to this point then most likely the <b>baby</b> is normal.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-birth-defects-are-associated-with-breech-babies></span>What birth defects are associated with breech babies?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Difficult spot: <b>Babies</b> in the <b>breech</b> position at <b>birth</b> are at increased risk of autism. Certain complications during pregnancy or delivery increase the chances of having a <b>child</b> with autism by 26 percent or more, according to a study of more than 400,000 mother-<b>child</b> pairs1.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-breech-baby></span>What are the characteristics of breech baby?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Types of <b>Breech Babies</b><p>In this position, the bottom is down, but the <b>baby’s</b> knees are also bent, so the feet are also down near the buttocks. The presenting part is not only the bottom but both feet as well. At delivery, about 10% of <b>breech babies</b> are in a complete <b>breech</b> position.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-breech-babies-come-early></span>Can breech babies come early?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Babies can</b> be <b>breech early</b> in pregnancy. Most of them turn on their own to be headfirst by the time of delivery. As you get closer to your due date, your doctor will be able to tell if your <b>baby</b> is <b>breech</b>. They <b>can</b> check by a physical exam, ultrasound, or both.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-breech-birth-more-painful></span>Is breech birth more painful?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Giving <b>birth</b> to a <b>breech baby</b> vaginally is not usually any <b>more painful</b> than a head-down position, as you’ll have the same <b>pain</b> relief options available to you, although it does carry a higher risk of perinatal morbidity (2:1000 compared to 1:1000 with a cephalic <b>baby</b>).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-a-breech-baby-mean-something-is-wrong></span>Does a breech baby mean something is wrong?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Can a <b>breech</b> presentation <b>mean something is wrong</b>? Even though most <b>breech babies</b> are born healthy, there is a slightly elevated risk for certain problems. Birth defects are slightly more common in <b>breech babies</b> and the defect might be the reason that the <b>baby</b> failed to move into the right position prior to delivery.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-late-can-a-breech-baby-turn></span>How late can a breech baby turn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The ideal position for birth is head-first. Most <b>babies</b> that are <b>breech</b> will naturally <b>turn</b> by about 36 to 37 weeks so that their head is facing downwards in preparation for birth, but sometimes this does not happen.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-babies-are-breech-at-32weeks></span>How many babies are breech at 32weeks?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Reasons for foetus being in <b>breech</b> presentation<p>The foetus is ideally expected to turn their head down by <b>32 weeks</b> of gestation. Prior to term about 25 per cent are in the <b>breech</b> position before 28 <b>weeks</b> of pregnancy, but by <b>32 weeks</b> only 7 per cent <b>babies are breech</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-do-you-feel-kicks-if-baby-is-breech></span>Where do you feel kicks if baby is breech?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>If</b> your <b>baby</b> is in <b>breech</b> position, you may <b>feel</b> her <b>kicking</b> in your lower belly. Or you may <b>feel</b> pressure under your ribcage, from her head.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-causes-a-baby-to-be-in-breech-position></span>What causes a baby to be in breech position?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>What causes breech position</b>? Most of the time, there is no clear <b>reason</b> why the <b>baby</b> did not turn head-down. In some cases, <b>breech position</b> may be linked to early labor, twins or more, problems with the uterus, or problems with the <b>baby</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-walking-help-a-breech-baby-turn></span>Can walking help a breech baby turn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Walking</b> for up to an hour a day may encourage your <b>baby’s</b> head – the heaviest part of the body – to gravitate downwards.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-should-you-sleep-if-baby-is-breech></span>How should you sleep if baby is breech?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>She agrees that <b>sleeping</b> on your side <b>with</b> a pillow between your legs — <b>with</b> as much of your leg on the pillows as possible — can help to create optimal positioning for a <b>baby</b> to turn. “Roll over, so your belly is touching the bed, <b>with</b> the rest of <b>you</b> supported by a lot of pillows.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-type-of-breech-is-easiest-to-turn></span>What type of breech is easiest to turn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When it comes to <b>turning</b> the baby, it’s no <b>easier to turn</b> a complete <b>breech</b> than it is to <b>turn</b> a frank <b>breech</b>. If you’re undergoing an ECV, doctors will often give you an injection to relax your uterus, since it’s <b>easier to turn</b> a fetus in a more relaxed uterus.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-doctors-manually-turn-a-breech-baby></span>How do doctors manually turn a breech baby?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>An external cephalic version is a procedure used to help <b>turn</b> a <b>baby</b> in the womb before delivery. During the procedure, your healthcare provider places their hands on the outside of your belly and attempts to <b>manually turn</b> the <b>baby</b>. This procedure may be recommended if your <b>baby</b> is in a <b>breech</b> position.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-should-you-worry-if-baby-is-breech></span>When should you worry if baby is breech?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>We</b> expect <b>babies to</b> turn <b>head down</b> by 28-32 weeks. <b>Breech</b> may <b>not</b> be an issue until 32-34 weeks. <b>If you</b> know your womb has an unusual limitation in shape or size, such as a bicornate uterus then begin body balancing before pregnancy and once 15 weeks in pregnancy.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-breech-babies-turn-after-36-weeks></span>Can breech babies turn after 36 weeks?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Breech</b> presentation means that your <b>baby</b> is positioned with its feet or bottom in your pelvis. It is common in early pregnancy, but most <b>babies</b> will <b>turn</b> to be head first by the time they are due to be born. If your <b>baby</b> is <b>breech</b> beyond <b>36 weeks</b> it is unlikely to <b>turn</b> to the head first position by itself.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-can-i-encourage-my-breech-baby-to-turn></span>How can I encourage my breech baby to turn?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Here’s a breakdown of the most common techniques for <b>turning</b> a <b>breech baby</b>.</b><li class=TrT0Xe>ECV.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Forward-leaning inversion.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Acupuncture and moxibustion.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Chiropractics: the Webster technique.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Pelvic tilt (aka the ironing-board technique)</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Swimming.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Music.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-chances-of-going-into-labor-with-a-breech-baby></span>What are the chances of going into labor with a breech baby?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If this is your first <b>baby</b> and they are <b>breech</b> at 36 weeks, the <b>chance</b> of the <b>baby</b> turning itself naturally before you <b>go into labour</b> is about 1 in 8.
