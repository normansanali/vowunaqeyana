Her musical career has been active since 2014.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Halsey is, as of early 2018? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Halsey’s net worth is over $5 million, accumulated through her successful involvement in the music industry.</p><h3><strong>Halsey Net Worth $5 Million</strong></h3><p>Halsey was raised with two younger brothers in her hometown by her father Chris Frangipane – a car dealer – and mother, Nicole Frangipane, who works in a hospital for a security crew. As a young girl, she played the cello, viola and violin until the age of 14, when she also started playing the acoustic guitar. Upon matriculation, Halsey enrolled into the Rhode Island School of Design, but soon quit her education as she couldn’t afford the tuition, and was also kicked out of home. Thus she started playing the guitar and performing in various night clubs, while living for some time with her grandmother. Parallel with her performances, Halsey started to write songs, and when her song “Ghost” achieved considerable success on SoundCloud, she signed a contract with Astralwerks Records.</p><p>So, Halsey’s professional musical career began in 2014, after a tour with The Kooks band, when she released her debut EP entitled “Room 93”, which peaked at No. 3 on the Top Heatseekers Charts, No. 37 on the Top Alternative Albums chart and No. 159 on the Billboard 200 chart, and which marked the beginning of an increase of her net worth.</p><p>In the following year, Halsey released her debut studio album entitled “Badlands”, which reached No. 2 on the US Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum by RIAA, and was positively critiqued by Rolling Stone magazine, adding a considerable amount to her net worth,&nbsp; especially as she co-wrote all songs from the album. During that period, she collaborated with <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> on his fourth studio album “Purpose”, and in 2016 she started her collaboration with The Chainsmokers on her single “Closer”, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart; the single was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, increasing her net worth by a large margin.</p><p>To speak further about her career, Halsey released the single “Not Afraid Anymore”, which found its place on the soundtrack for the film “Fifty Shades Darker” (2017). In June of the same year, out came her second studio album entitled “Hopeless Fountain Kingdom”, which reached the top of the Billboard 200 chart with two hit singles – “Now Or Never” and “Bad At Love”. She is currently on the Hopeless Fountain Kingdom World Tour to promote her album – her net worth is certainly still rising.</p><p>When it comes to speak about her personal life, Halsey has been in a relationship with rapper <a href=#>G-Eazy</a> since July of 2017. She previously dated Norwegian music producer Lido (2014-2016) and Ashton Irwin in 2016. At the age of 17, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, after which she became addicted to drugs and tried to commit suicide. Nowadays she participates in the campaign against suicide. In her spare time, Halsey is active on her official Instagram account.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.084342211461><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Halsey</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 29, 1994</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>October 31, 2014, New Braunfels, Texas, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Edison, New Jersey, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.63 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>54 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Songwriter</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Rhode Island School of Design</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Chris Frangipane, Nicole Frangipane</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>G-Eazy</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/HalseyMusic</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.42424242424242><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/halsey</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://plus.google.com/+iamhalsey</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.40909090909091><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/iamhalsey</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/halsey37</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7214498</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27118644067797><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/halsey-mn0003010517</a></td></tr><tr readability=19><td>Awards</td><td>iHeartRadio Music Award for Dance Song of the Year, Myx Music Award for Favorite International Video, Colors, Gasoline, New Americana, Los Angeles, CA, United States, Bern, Switzerland, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, Ireland, iHeartRadio Music Award for Dance Song of the Year, Myx Music Award for Favorite I...</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Nominations</td><td>MTV Europe Music Award for Best Push Artist, Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, People's Choice Award for Favorite Breakout Artist, iHeartRadio Music Award for Song of the Year, Teen Choice Award for Choice Song from a Movie or TV Show, iHeartRadio Music Award for Best Lyrics, iHeartRa...</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Musical Guest</td></tr><tr><td>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Musical guest</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Last Call with Carson Daly</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Musical Guest</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqGYpauVrnqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-long-did-reggie-bush-play-in-the-nfl.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How long did Reggie Bush play in the NFL?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./209879-fans-say-family-matters-star-kellie-s-wi-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fans Say 'Family Matters' Star Kellie S Williams' Son John Looks Life Her in a New Photo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp;
