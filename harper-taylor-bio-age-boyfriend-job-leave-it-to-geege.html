Among them is Harper Taylor and this ‘Harper Taylor Bio’ is her journey on the show as well as her age, boyfriend, and job-related stories.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Harper Taylor On Leave It To Geege</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>So, Leave It To Geege is from none other than the Emmy-winning producers from World of Wonder.</p><p style=text-align:left>It features <a href=#>Geege Taylor</a>, an Atlanta area single mother of two whom life could be a Lifetime movie, as the makers claim. She has been twice-divorced, survived breast cancer has been all along advocating for autism acceptance in hopes to educate and help others navigate their way through the ups and downs of raising an autistic child. That is of course following her first-hand experience with her non-verbal 19-year-old son Pootie.</p><p>Geege’s family is just as much the part of this show. There’s Geege’s Southern to the core mother Puddin’ and enters Harper Taylor.</p><p>Harper is Geege’s daughter and Pootie’s elder sister. You may also see Harper’s best friends Nicky, George, and Tyler.</p><p>And together all these people shall show the viewers glimpses from the chaos and charm of their authentic modern family relationships, i.e, of course, filled with love and laughter.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Harper Taylor Dad</strong></h3><p>Just as the theme of&nbsp;Leave It To Geege&nbsp;suggests Harper Taylor’s parents are divorced and no longer living with each other.</p><p>Anyway, let us tell you who Harper’s dad is.</p><p>His name is Ainsworth Gatewood Dudley, Jr. and he married Harper’s mother Angie ‘Geege’ Taylor on 18 February 2002. And then came along Harper and her brother Ainsworth III.</p><p>Harper’s folks were seemingly married until before 2010. As of that time, Harper’s mom was dubbed as a stay-at-home mother who resided in Athens with her two kids and husband Ainsworth.</p><p>Fast forward to several years, Harper’s dad has been practicing as a lawyer at JUSTIA LAWYERS&nbsp;in Georgia. Meanwhile, his ex-wife and Harper’s mom, age 54, seemed content in a different kind of life with taking care of kids. Of course, that life also includes her boyfriend, Mark.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>How Old Is Harper Taylor?</strong></h3><p>Harper Taylor was 24 years old when she first appeared on&nbsp;Leave It To Geege.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Does Harper Taylor Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Harper Taylor did not seem to have a boyfriend as of the time of this writing.</p><p>Her social media did not give away any hint on her dating life. At the same, Harper’s so far shown stories on the reality TV show, also did not portray her as anyone’s girlfriend/partner.</p><p>That draws us to the conclusion that Harper is likely single.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Harper Taylor Job</strong></h3><p>So in her introduction on Leave It To Geege, Harper Taylor confirms being an art student at the University of Georgia. A sneak peek of Harper on the show also sees her fun-enough arts-related conversation with her grandmother.</p><p>Grandmother: I am just concerned about one thing…</p><p>Harper: What?</p><p>Grandmother: [Joking] You doing N*DES!</p><p>Harper: Oh my Gosh! [with a little laugh]</p><p>Grandmother, Frances Hoge Harper, was talking about Harper’s style of arts. And we see Harper doing these “nudes” anyway, on Instagram.</p><p>Grandmother Frances, if you should know, is still married to her husband/Harper’s grandfather William “Billy” Whitehead Harper.</p><p>And surprisingly the elderly also studied at the University of Georgia just like Harper.</p><p>Anyway, back to Harper’s job as an artist again!</p><p>While still in college, Harper also made some money from selling her drawings or from making one as per the client’s demand. As of October 2020, she had started taking commissions too. Other than that she was charging $50 for the mini human figure charcoal ones.</p><p>She was also working more around the time because she had taken the semester off due to COVID. It also helped during the pandemic because her work is solely based on photographs. As a result, she did not have to meet with her clients in person. They just had to send her a photograph for a price estimate.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Harper Taylor On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Harper Taylor could be spotted on Instagram as of 15 January 2022. From the look of the account @harperportraiture, comprised of 31 posts and some 401 followers, Harper seemed to be very much into the arts. This part of the internet is typically an exhibition of her drawings and sketches.</p><p>Also, Harper ran separate personal accounts on Instagram as well as Facebook. While the one on IG was kept on private mode, she could be seen sharing her daily life glimpses from time to time on her ‘Harper Calhoun’ Facebook. (Yes, Harper also goes around by Harper Calhoun. Why? It was not yet understood.)</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>When Is Harper Taylor Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Harper Taylor was yet to tell us when she celebrates her birthday.
