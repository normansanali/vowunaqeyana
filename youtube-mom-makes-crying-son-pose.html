While it can be argued that almost all forms of entertainment does this to some capacity, the difference between a tasteful show of someone struggling to persevere in an emotionally difficult situation and another just trying to tug on heartstrings to <a href=#>"display" their emotions is palpable</a>.</p><p>There's no shortage of social media stars and personalities who do the latter, and when it comes to a massive platform like YouTube, there are thousands of influencers who will utilize tried and true thumbnail images designed to get as many clicks as possible so they can hoodwink folks into effectively "buying" content that presents itself as a raw display of human emotions.</p><p>However, as it isn't hard to imagine, there's a large number of influencers who know exactly what they're doing and won't hesitate to forego humanity and common decency in a bid to get people to click on their clips.</p><p>Which is something that Vlogger Jordan Cheyenne has found herself wrestling with in the wake of a recent scandal that involved her crying son and the illness of their family puppy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Jordan accidentally uploaded an unedited video of her and her son crying over their poor pup's medical condition. Her 9-year-old is visibly distraught over the situation in the clip, but what troubled viewers the most was the very end of the video, where Jordan tells the child, "act like you're crying" as she holds him and poses for a thumbnail to use in the video.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>this is so DISTURBING what is wrong with mom vloggers omfg <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/krUjM5Sfit</a></p>— elle woods ♿︎ 24 (@artangeIII) <a href=#>September 8, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>everyone keeps asking the same questions</p><p>• this is about the puppy they just bought having parvo<br>• the son IS crying. real tears. shes forcing him to “fake cry” for views<br>• it was accidentally uploaded, she forgot to edit this part<br>• she removed the vid & posted an ‘apology’</p>— elle woods ♿︎ 24 (@artangeIII) <a href=#>September 9, 2021</a></figure><p>The boy responds with tears in his eyes saying, "I am crying."
