The 49-year-old accumulated a long list of accomplishments throughout his 13 seasons with the Colts, cementing his position as not only one of his team’s, but also one of the game’s finest wide receivers. In 2022, let’s examine Marvin Harrison’s net worth.</p><h3>Marvin Harrison’s net worth in 2022 (Estimate): $26.8 million<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Marvin-Harrisons-net-worth-in-2022-Marvin-Harrisons-2022-net-worth-Marvin-Harrison-net-worth-in-2022-1-1024x574-1.jpg alt="reggie wayne net worth,peyton manning net worth,marvin harrison age,marvin harrison instagram,marvin harrison son,marvin harrison hall of fame,marvin harrison height,marvin harrison 2022,marvin harrison net worth,marvin harrison net worth 2021,marvin harrison net worth 2022,marvin harrison net worth 2019,marvin harrison jr net worth,marvin harrison sr net worth,marvin harrison all time stats,marvin hier net worth,marvin harris net worth" width=1024 height=574 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Marvin Harrison’s 2022 net worth, 2022 net worth for Marvin Harrison, and 2022 net worth for Marvin Harrison</p><p>In 2022, Marvin Harrison will have a net worth of $26,8 million. Numerous sources, including Celebrity Net Worth, claim as much.</p><p>Harrison signed up for a Syracuse University course. The future Colts great, according to IndyStar, actually started out as a running back. He didn’t adapt to his new position as a wide receiver until he started playing for the Syracuse Orange football team, mostly so he could get an opportunity to play regularly. He worked hard and eventually started the programme for three years. He amassed 2,718 receiving yards in total during his career with the team from 1992 to 1995, more than any other player. Until 2017, when future NFL wide receiver Steve Ishmael broke it in the final game of his collegiate career, this was the best record in Syracuse history. Harrison played with future six-time Pro Bowler and Philadelphia Eagles icon Donovan McNabb during the final year of his career with Syracuse.</p><p>The former Syracuse receiver was later named to the College Football Hall of Fame ballot for four straight years, most recently in 2021, in appreciation of his noteworthy accomplishment.</p><p>Harrison was chosen by the Indianapolis Colts with the 19th overall choice in the 1996 NFL Draft. He later agreed to his first contract with the organisation, a $5.8 million, five-year one, according to Spotrac. The choice was actually acquired through a deal involving former quarterback Jeff George between the <a href=#>Atlanta</a> Falcons and the Indianapolis Colts. This eventually turned out to be a very sensible choice, as Harrison went on to become one of the top receivers in his draught cl ass and spent his entire NFL career (from 1996 to 2008) with the Colts.</p><p>Obviously, all of this did contribute to Marvin Harrison’s wealth in 2022. There’s more, though!</p><p>Harrison would establish himself as one of the most successful receivers in the game over the course of his 13-year career. The native of Philadelphia actually continued to set numerous league records. Most notably, Harrison shared the league lead in receiving touchdowns in 2005 and led the league in receiving yards in 1999, 2000, and 2002. In the NFL, he joined an exclusive group of seven wide receivers who have scored 100 touchdowns. Harrison retired with career earnings of approximately $68.8 million, according to Spotrac.</p><p>Harrison is currently content to live a calm life with his family of four. Marvin Jr. and Jet, their two kids, were born to him and Dawne Harrison. After graduating from St. Joseph’s Prep, Marvin Jr. played football like his father. Marvin Harrison Jr. declared his commitment to Ohio State University in 2019 and joined the recruiting class of 2021. The 6’3″, 205-pound freshman presently plays wide receiver, just like Marvin Sr., according to his ESPN <a href=#>biography</a>.</p><p>The Super Bowl XLI champion reportedly lends a hand at his alma school, Roman Catholic High School, twice or three times per week, according to 2016 reports by IndyStar. Harrison has maintained his modesty all these years. The three-time Pro Bowler explained how he played the game back when he was on the field by saying:</p><p>Harrison said, “I know I never settled for the week before. “I always tried to play the perfect game, regardless of how many catches or yards I had. I still doubt that I’ve ever had a game that was flawless. Create each block? Run the routes 16 yards when they should be 16 yards, instead. Use your hands for every catch? There are numerous factors involved. I’m a stickler for detail.</p><p>His efforts had not been in vain. Harrison had amassed a Hall of Fame resume by the time he quietly left the NFL in 2009 after sitting out the whole previous campaign. In addition to winning the Super Bowl and being chosen for the NFL’s 2000s All-Decade and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams, eight Pro Bowl honours were also earned by the player, along with three first-team and five second-team All-Pro selections. In 2011, Harrison was additionally admitted into the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor. And to top it all off, he was admitted into the 2016 Class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><p>Were you surprised by Marvin Harrison’s wealth in 2022, given all of this?</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="reggie wayne net worth,peyton manning net worth,marvin harrison age,marvin harrison instagram,marvin harrison son,marvin harrison hall of fame,marvin harrison height,marvin harrison 2022,marvin harrison net worth,marvin harrison net worth 2021,marvin harrison net worth 2022,marvin harrison net worth 2019,marvin harrison jr net worth,marvin harrison sr net worth,marvin harrison all time stats,marvin hier net worth,marvin harris net worth" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
