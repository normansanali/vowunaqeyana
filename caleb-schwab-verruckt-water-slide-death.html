Police confirmed to TIME on Tuesday that the boy was decapitated in the accident. He was found dead at the bottom of the ride in a pool.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Schwab boarded the raft with two women who were not related to him. They both suffered minor cuts and scrapes on their face in the incident.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Wyandotte County coroner’s office conducted an autopsy on Monday but it is unclear whether they will publicly release the results.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Caleb’s parents, Republican state Rep. Scott Schwab and his wife, Michele said in a statement Sunday: “Since the day he was born, [Caleb] brought abundant joy to our family and all those he came in contact with.” A memorial service is planned for Friday,<a href=# rel=noopener> according</a> to ABC 7 News.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The park issued a statement Monday saying it was “deeply and intensely saddened for the Schwab family and all who were impacted by the tragic accident.” The water park closed following the incident and will remain shuttered until Wednesday at the earliest, although the slide will not reopen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Eyewitness Accounts</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Witness Kelsey Friedrichsen said she was about to ride the waterslide when she saw emergency responders below covering the boy and attending to the two injured. “It looked like he must have somehow been ejected from his seat, bounced around between the netting and the slide and just slid down,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>PEOPLE.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another witness, who had gone down the slide earlier that day, noted that his cousin’s 14-year-old daughter, who was in the raft with him, complained that the Velcro on her safety belt had come undone, reports <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC 7 News.</a> The witness, Esteban Castaneda, said he heard booms before seeing the boy wash down the slide after the raft.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Water Slide Glitches</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Verruckt is one of the water park’s main attractions. Passengers board a three-person raft and experience a 17-story drop before being “blasted back up a second massive hill” to drop down another 50ft. Riders must be at least 54 inches tall and the group cannot <a href=# rel=noopener>weigh more than a</a> combined total of 400 to 550 pounds, according to the park’s website.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Certified by the Guinness World Records as the world’s tallest, the slide is no stranger to controversy. Its scheduled opening back in 2014 was delayed reportedly due to alarming complications including one that saw water rafts detach from the slide and fly off into the air.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Schlitterbahn co-owner, Jeff Henry, reportedly <a href=# rel=noopener>said </a>that there were engineering challenges behind the design with calculations originally based on roller coasters rather than water slides, according to<a href=# rel=noopener> USA Today. </a>However, after a redesign and more tests, Henry <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> the ride, although still dangerous, was safe: “it’s a safe dangerous now.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Rules and Regulations</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After Caleb’s death, <a href=# rel=noopener>advocates urged officials</a> to step in to change how the amusement park industry is run.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There is no single federal agency responsible for enforcing rules and regulations at Schlitterbahn, which is monitored by the state’s Department of Labor. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission only has jurisdiction over traveling amusement parks, like pop-up carnivals.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Advocates say that lack of federal oversight, and the fact that regulations vary by state, is problematic since there is no uniform way to oversee the industry.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Read more about other injuries at Schlitterbahn in Kansas here.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Something more has to be done. We owe it to this child’s family,” said Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit that works to improve safety related to children’s products.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbGRpgXWDjpyYpZ2SYsCktNaamWaulae%2Ftq%2FKrWSwmaSav26%2Fy6KbnmWUmq61tI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cannoli-dip.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cannoli Dip Modern Honey</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./boston-angry-prince-william-kate-middleton-visit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Boston Is Apparently Really Angry That the Royals Are Visiting</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
