And I have this scar now, but it has made me grow stronger.”</p><p>The health scare came in the midst of the Dancing With the Stars: Live! tour earlier this year. After taking a blood test, Bersten learned that he had a tumor on one of his parathyroid glands, a condition known as hyperparathyroidism.</p><p>“I was very in tune with my body,” he says. “I was lucky because I felt something was off. So I went in.”</p><p>Luckily, the tumor was benign and the recovery process was quick. Within days, the dancer began rehearsals for the first-ever athletes season of the ABC competition with his partner, Olympic figure skater <a href=#><strong>Mirai Nagasu</strong></a>.</p><p>Over time, Bersten’s self-conscious feelings went away. “I don’t care what people think, and I want to preach that to everyone,” he tells Us. “As long as you’re having a good time, as long as you’re doing your best, that’s all that matters. So, I mean, it really opened up my eyes a little bit in a way that people don’t really care that much, you know? You should stop caring about what other people think.”</p><p>The choreographer is currently competing on <a href=#>season 27 of DWTS with model <strong>Alexis Ren</strong></a>. He will also mentor <strong>Sky Brown</strong> and <strong>JT Church</strong> on the upcoming spinoff Dancing With the Stars: Juniors.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He taught me how to just be confident and just don’t care,” skateboarder Brown, 10, tells Us. So You Think You Can Dance alum Church, 12, echoes, “Alan’s taught me to be a good partner and to always be there.”</p><p>Dancing With the Stars airs on ABC Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET. The Juniors edition premieres on Sunday, October 7, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Emily Marcus</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadr6SoeqK4wKdkm52iqMGmuoyopWadnZe%2Foq%2FIp55moJmoerSvwKtkmp6kmr9uwNSmpqtlopq6sMLApWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-bollok-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Frank Bollok Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./danny-ramirez-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Danny Ramirez career earnings, salary and net worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
