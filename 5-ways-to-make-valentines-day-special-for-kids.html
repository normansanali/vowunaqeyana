WRITE THEM VALENTINE’S DAY LETTERS</b>.</span> Tell them all the things you love about them. Here are some great ideas for specific compliments you can give them —&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span><a href=#>99 Kids Compliments</a>.&nbsp;</span></strong>If you have more than one child, have your kids write valentines to each other. &nbsp;I found glitter hearts of various sizes in a package at Hobby Lobby (also seen at Michael’s and Target) and glued an envelope on the back with their name on it. I took red and white twine and hung each of them from the ceiling.</p><p>My Mom always hung them in the entry of our home but mine are hung over my dining room table. My kids can’t wait to run downstairs in the morning to find their envelopes filled with notes! My Mom raised 5 boys and 1 girl (me) and to this day, my brothers will tell you that they loved reading their notes on Valentine’s Day.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0730ed.jpg alt="5 ways to make Valentine's Day special for kids" width=3834 height=3008 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span><strong>2. MAKE A SPECIAL VALENTINE’S DAY BREAKFAST</strong>.</span> Growing up, my Mom made sure we had <strong><span>pink pancakes, pink milk, and even pink eggs</span></strong>. Our tradition is to serve strawberry milk, Goldie’s pancakes with fresh strawberries, and homemade whipped cream. &nbsp;The kids get strawberry milk once a year and they look forward to this breakfast. I usually set the table the night before, after the kids go to bed.

They are about $1-2 for a big package and you can put the hearts on their plate and write their names on them or you can tape the hearts on the walls to make it look festive. You can find them at the Dollar store, Michael’s, Hobby Lobby, JoAnn’s, Walmart, and sometimes Target. The mailboxes can be found in the dollar section of Target.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0593-copy.jpg alt="Goldie's Buttermilk Pancakes. 5 Ways to Make Valentine's Special for Kids" width=4249 height=4000 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>3. <strong>MAKE and DECORATE SUGAR COOKIES TOGETHER</strong>.</span> There is something about kids cutting out their own sugar cookies that they seem to really enjoy.
