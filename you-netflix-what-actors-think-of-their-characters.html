This intense drama is about a young man who finds himself obsessively falling in love with women. Instead of stalking them from afar, he enters into their lives, creates relationships with them, and makes them think he needs them. In the first season of the show, we saw him completely consume the life of a college girl and then ultimately lock her up in a cage before killing her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the second season of the show, we saw that he finally met his match. He came across a woman who was just as crazy as he was, if not worse. Find out what the cast of the show thinks of the characters they play.</p><h2 id=penn-badgley-says-joe-goldberg-is-a-murderer-and-sociopath><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Penn Badgley&nbsp;Says Joe Goldberg Is A Murderer And Sociopath</span></h2><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a class=class href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Penn Badgley spoke about the character of Joe Goldberg saying, "He’s not actually a person who just needs somebody who loves him. He’s a murderer! He’s a sociopath. He’s abusive. He’s delusional. And he’s self-obsessed." We can totally agree. The character of Joe Goldberg is someone no one should want to get stuck alone in a room with.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-lail-has-a-lot-of-heart-for-guinevere-beck><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Elizabeth Lail Has A Lot Of Heart For&nbsp;Guinevere Beck</span></h2><p>In an interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Lail spoke about Beck</a> saying, "I find her very relatable because she is so imperfect. And I know I certainly am and I hope I’m not the only one trying to figure out life and making mistakes and trying to learn from them. So I have a lot of heart for her." Beck is one of the most relatable and realistic fictional characters on television. She is a normal college student who stumbles upon love with a guy that she thinks is totally perfect for her... but she has no idea how psycho he is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shay-mitchell-considers-peach-salinger-a-misunderstood-queen-bee><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Shay Mitchell Considers Peach Salinger A Misunderstood Queen Bee</span></h2><p class=entertainment><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shay Mitchell</a> discussed the character she plays on YOU, Peach Salinger, and said, "If you just read the breakdown of who Peach is, it’s like, 'Queen bee, who does what she wants and who’s a b****.' But if you do a deeper dive, there are reasons for why she’s like that. Growing up, she lived in a beautiful, big home, and it had everything that she wanted, but that doesn’t make you feel loved."

Everybody from politicians to people in show business, they think they can do whatever they want and they don't have to pay the price. That's not right. There's consequences to people's actions, and it doesn't seem like anybody cares about that in this show."

Right now we see her as somebody who's incredibly hurt and has been screwed over and kind of got the worst of the worst — to bring her back and make her a murderer like Joe defeats the purpose because that's not her character and that's not in her heart."

She’s more clever than Joe. She seems to manipulate the system with such ease and confidence... She really just skates on through with no consideration for the consequences. That’s part of why she has this really easy nature about her that seems so sweet, calm, and easy."

That's the most important thing. She wants Joe to be real and honest about who he really is and the things that he's done. She wants to stop him from doing it again.

Also, I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but the name of the gentleman who sold me weed in New York, his name was Forty, and I loved him. Anytime anybody said my name in a table read, [they] just chuckled. What a ridiculous thing to name your child."

We can easily understand why Penn Badgley does not see Joe Goldberg as a character that has the capability to change in a genuine way.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-lail-believes-beck-was-hard-on-herself><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Elizabeth Lail Believes Beck Was Hard On Herself</span></h2><p>When describing the character of Beck, Elizabeth Lail said, "She is very hard on herself, and I am as well in that regard, as a young woman in New York, artist, and just trying to figure out how to deal with my emotional life and my financial life and my love life.
