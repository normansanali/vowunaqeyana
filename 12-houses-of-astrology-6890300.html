The 12 houses of the zodiac are one piece of the natal chart puzzle, from which you can gain interesting intel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For instance, someone can be born with the sun in the first house of self or the twelfth house of spirituality. Understanding what each means can help you understand why you're such an extrovert while your bestie or S.O. is far more reserved.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Astrological houses represent areas of our lives. Where each planet is and in which sign can offer insight into what may make us tick or the areas we're poised for success.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling to find out what the basics of the houses in astrology can tell you about yourself and your path.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-astrological-houses-defined></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Astrological Houses, Defined</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 12 houses show where in the sky each luminary (that’s the sun and the moon) and the planets appeared when you were born, wherever on Earth you were born.&nbsp;Houses represent the rotation of the earth around its axis over 24 hours.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As it rotates, the sun, moon, and all the planets appear to be moving through the 12 houses clockwise. They rise in the east (on the cusp of the first house, or the ascendant), hang out around the top of a chart at midday, set in the west (the right-hand side of your chart), and then spend time at the bottom of a chart in the middle of the night.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can think of this as a personalized star map — but it’s more than that. The house location of the luminaries and planets colors how they express themselves (more on that in a bit).&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-find-the-houses-in-your-birth-chart></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Find the Houses in Your Birth Chart</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Photo: Getty Images / ilbusca</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with many astrology concepts, when it comes to understanding the houses, it helps to have a visual. What better visual than your own birth chart? If you don't already have it handy, you can run one on an app like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>TimePassages</a>&nbsp;or the website&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>astro.com</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Note that the chart is divided up into 12 slices. Each of these slices represents a house, and the first house is where your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ascendant or rising sign</a> (the sign that was ascending on the eastern horizon at the time of your birth) falls on the left-hand side of the chart.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From the first house, you'll want to follow your chart counterclockwise to note your second, third, fourth house, and so on. As you move through the houses, you'll notice that each is ruled by one of the 12 zodiac signs. You'll also glean that your planetary placements — including your sun sign, moon sign, and Mercury sign — reside within a particular house.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-each-of-the-12-houses-in-astrology-mean></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Each of the 12 Houses in Astrology Mean</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The First House of Self</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This house is the location of your ascendant or rising sign, which speaks to how you present yourself in the world.

It also involves siblings and short-distance travel.</p><p>Astrological houses represent areas of our lives.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Fourth House of Home Life</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fourth house speaks to your family life, inner world, and domestic sphere.

Explore any placements and the ruling sign of this house for intel on your relationship with your parents and how you'll act as a parent.

Look at any placements and which sign rules the house in your chart for clues on how you incorporate playfulness into your life, express your artistic visions, and own your voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Sixth House of Wellness and Daily Routine</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sixth house, associated with mutable earth sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Virgo</a>&nbsp;and information-gathering Mercury, is the house of health and your day-to-day hustle. Planetary placements and the ruling sign here inform how you check off your to-do list and care for your physical, emotional, and mental well-being.

Any placements in this house, as well as the ruling sign, color how you approach pairing up. Because it sits opposite the first house of self, lessons from the seventh house can bolster self-awareness. How do you show up for others, and what does that say about your sense of self?</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Eighth House of Intimacy and Joint Resources</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Associated with the fixed water sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Scorpio</a>&nbsp;and transformative Pluto, this house is one of the most complex. It oversees sex, death, rebirth, joint resources, transformation, and our most intimate emotional bonds. Look to the sign ruling this house in your chart as well as any placements for how you contend with these heavier — but also deeply fulfilling — aspects of life.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Ninth House of Adventure and Higher Learning</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The ninth house, associated with mutable fire sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sagittarius</a>&nbsp;and fortune-bringing Jupiter, is the house of long-distance travel and higher education. Placements here, as well as the sign that rules the house in your chart, can tell you about your sense of wanderlust, how you aim to broaden your horizons, and how you soak up knowledge and approach philosophical conversations. It's also the house of publishing, foreign languages, and religion.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Tenth House of Career</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Associated with the cardinal earth sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Capricorn</a>&nbsp;and taskmaster Saturn, the tenth house cusp is referred to as the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>midheaven (MC)</a>, which speaks to your professional path, social standing, and public persona. Similarly, the whole tenth house offers intel on how you get after your greatest ambitions in life, how you deal with authority figures — and may act as one, and how you feel about taking on responsibility, particularly in a very public way.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Eleventh House of Networking and Long-Term Wishes</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The eleventh house, associated with fixed air sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aquarius</a>&nbsp;and rebellious Uranus, is all about friends and colleagues, although not on a one-on-one basis (the seventh house) or how you connect (the third house). Instead, the eleventh house informs the teams, groups, and networks you associate with. It can also indicate the greater audiences you appeal to. It also involves hopes, wishes, and how you express your humanity and sense of community.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Twelfth House of Spirituality and the Unconscious</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The twelfth house of spirituality and the unconscious is associated with mutable water sign&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pisces</a>&nbsp;and illusion-loving Neptune.
