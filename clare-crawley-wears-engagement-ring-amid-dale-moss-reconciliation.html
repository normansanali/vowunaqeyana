As she brought her pint-sized drink to her lips, a sparkly piece of jewelry on her ring finger drew attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/She-Said-Yes-Again-Clare-Wears-Engagement-Ring-Amid-Dale-Reunion-003.jpg><p>Bachelor Nation fans watched Crawley and Moss, 32, get engaged during a November 2020 episode of the ABC reality series. The pair fell for each other so quickly that they chose to exit <a href=#>after less than two weeks</a> of filming, leaving <a href=#><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a> to step in as the season’s lead. By January, Us Weekly exclusively confirmed the pair had called it quits.</p><p>“Clare and Dale <a href=#>did not agree on a lot of things in the long run</a> when they sat down and really discussed the future of their relationship. … They finally realized that perhaps they did move too quickly after all,” a source revealed at the time.</p><p>The former football player later <a href=#>addressed his split</a> from the hairstylist, hinting that the end of their relationship “didn’t come out of nowhere.” One month after their dramatic public breakup, the reality stars were spotted holding hands and getting drinks in Florida. At the time, an eyewitness revealed that the duo <a href=#>“100 percent” looked like they were “in love”</a> while dining out at Rosebud’s Steak & Seafood House in Osprey, Florida.</p><p>Us confirmed later that month that the twosome <a href=#>got back together</a>, but in March, a source explained that “nothing has been made official with regards to an engagement.” Another insider noted at the time that <a href=#>Crawley and Moss were “taking things slowly”</a> this time around, but they were “supporting each other” as they navigated their post-Bachelorette lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/She-Said-Yes-Again-Clare-Wears-Engagement-Ring-Amid-Dale-Reunion-002.jpg><p>While they had previously played coy about their status, the duo <a href=#>went public with their reconciliation</a> earlier this month. “Selfie skills on 💯,” the South Dakota native captioned an Instagram Story of himself and Crawley posing in front of a bathroom mirror with coffee cups in their hands.</p><p>The following week, Moss shared more insights about where he stands with the Bachelor alum during an interview on <a href=#>the “Hollywood Raw” podcast with&nbsp;<strong>Dax Holt</strong> and <strong>Adam Glyn</strong></a>, hinting that “everyone will know in due time” what’s really going on with the couple.</p><p>“We’re just living life and we’re doing it and being present with one another,” he explained, confirming that Crawley still had the Neil Lane engagement ring. “It’s been great to go about it that way.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though he asserted that they were “in a good place” at the moment, Moss admitted that parts of his split from Crawley were harder to deal with than others. Rumors surfaced amid the duo’s breakup that the model had been unfaithful, but a source told Us at the time that <a href=#>Moss “never cheated.”</a> Still, the speculation was tough to work through.</p><p>“That was never a conversation, even when we went through our split. It wasn’t even a thing,” he said on the podcast. “You really have to look past that and focus on one another. I mean, that sucked. When things are going at your character, and something you’re completely against, those are the hardest things to handle. … But it was short-lived. I go to bed at night and not sweat about whether those things were truthful or not, because that’s not in my character. It’s just a learning experience.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacpJGnsm6v0ZqupZ2pYsSmrdGsZJ6ml5a0prnEp6tmqpmjtG6tzKKbZpyRobJuuc6sqmaqlZi8r6%2FIpaCarJmku3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./grace-hopper.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Grace Hopper, The Math Genius Who Revolutionized Computers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./christopher-myers-net-worth-261893.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christopher Myers Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
