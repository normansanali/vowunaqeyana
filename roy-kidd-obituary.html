He passed away on Tuesday at the age of 91.</p><p><strong>A Remarkable Coaching Career</strong></p><p>Born on December 4, 1931, in Corbin, Kentucky, Roy Kidd’s journey in football began as a standout three-sport athlete at Corbin High School. His exceptional talent and dedication paved the way for his arrival at Eastern Kentucky University (EKU), where he excelled as a record-setting Little All-American quarterback and a star center fielder for the Colonels’ baseball team.</p><p>Kidd’s connection with EKU ran deep, and after serving as an assistant football coach in 1963, he took the reins as the head coach in 1964. What followed was a remarkable coaching career that spanned nearly four decades. Under his guidance, the EKU Colonels achieved unparalleled success, including two NCAA Division I-AA Football Championships in 1979 and 1982, and 16 Ohio Valley Conference titles.</p><p><strong>A Legacy of Excellence</strong></p><p>Coach Roy Kidd’s achievements extended beyond trophies and championships. He instilled values of hard work, sportsmanship, and dedication in his players, molding them into not just formidable athletes but also outstanding individuals. During his tenure, he tutored 55 All-Americans, with 41 of his players going on to sign NFL contracts.</p><p>In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the sport, Coach Kidd was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2003. At the time of his retirement in 2002, he was second in all-time wins among coaches in Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) play.</p><p><strong>A Lasting Impact</strong></p><p>Roy Kidd’s influence extended well beyond the football field. EKU named its stadium in his honor, and the university erected a statue to commemorate his contributions in 2017. The street in front of the stadium was also renamed Roy and Sue Kidd Way, a testament to his enduring legacy.</p><p>In January, Coach Kidd received the prestigious Amos Alonzo Stagg Award from the American Football Coaches Association, recognizing his outstanding service in advancing the best interests of football.</p><p>Even after retiring from coaching, Roy Kidd continued to contribute to EKU, working part-time in the university’s development office. His dedication to the institution, its students, and the sport of football was unwavering.</p><p>In the words of EKU Athletics Director Matt Roan, “College football is better for having Roy Kidd on the sidelines, EKU is better for having Roy Kidd on its campus, and we are all better for knowing and working with him. Thank you, Coach!”</p><p>A memorial service in honor of Coach Roy Kidd is being planned at the EKU Center for the Arts, with details of the service to be announced at a later date. Coach Kidd’s impact on the world of football and on the lives of those he touched will be remembered for generations to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqfrnqstcOdZKiamanCor7YaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./keyshia-kaoir.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Jamaican/American entrepreneur Keyshia Ka'Oir child, Marital Details.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./precious-lee-model-bio-wiki-age-height-family-husband-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Precious Lee (Model) Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Husband and Net Worth.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
