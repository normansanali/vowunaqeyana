Now, a year after his initial announcement, Alex has provided an update as to how his fight with the disease is going.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How is Alex doing today?</h2><p>In a video update shared yesterday, the host said the just reached a milestone. "Hi, everyone. If you've got a minute I'd like to bring you up to date on my health situation,” Alex said in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>. ”The one-year&nbsp;survival rate for stage 4 pancreatic cancer patients is 18 percent. I'm very happy to report I&nbsp;have just reached that marker.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Alex, who is not currently in remission, continued by saying that his journey hadn’t been easy, but that it was worth the fight. “There were moments of great pain, days when certain bodily functions no longer function and sudden, massive attacks of great depression that made me wonder if it really was worth fighting on,” the host said, before explaining the reason he kept pushing forward.&nbsp;</p><p>“But I brushed that aside quickly because that would have been a massive betrayal — a betrayal of my wife and soulmate, Jean, who has given her all to help me survive,” the host said. “It would have been a betrayal of other cancer patients who have looked to me as an inspiration and a cheerleader of sorts of the value of living and hope, and it certainly would have been a betrayal of my faith in God and the millions of prayers that have been said on my behalf.”&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alex is looking toward the future.</h2><p>The host concluded the video by saying that he’ll keep the show's fans updated, and believes that anything is possible if he continues living one day at a time. The host has said in the past that he has <a href=#>no plans</a> to retire from his role hosting the show unless his health begins to restrict his ability to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Alex’s religion?</h2><p>Given the way he referenced his faith in the video, many Jeopardy! fans are wondering exactly what faith the host ascribes to. His statement suggests that he’s a Christian, and it’s not the first piece of evidence that the 79-year-old host is a believer in God.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SurvivorNet</a>, Alex’s wife Jean Currivan Trebek explained how Alex’s faith has helped him in his battle with cancer. She said that she also tries to uplift her husband as he fights the illness. “It comes from a place of love, because I want to uplift him … and when I keep my own self buoyed and enjoying my life, I can actually share that with him,” she said. “He can look at me and have a sense of ‘life is beautiful; my wife is doing something good.”&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, Alex has kept his religious beliefs largely to himself. In light of his diagnosis, though, it seems like the host is much more willing to discuss his faith, and the ways he and his wife have used it to lighten their own loads.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmmxIytqZ6alaB6s7HLop6ip54%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yul-brynner.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yul Brynner - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Married, Nationality, Wiki, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bluey-the-sign-synopsis-watch-without-kids-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Non-Parents Guide to Bluey</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
