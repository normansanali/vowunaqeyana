The Mexican-American singer, 42, was traveling on a private jet early Sunday with six others when the aircraft went missing. Rivera was presumed dead when the wreckage was discovered Sunday afternoon with no survivors.</p><p>"We are feeling devastated. It's a devastation to the family," Rivera's brother, Pedro Rivera Jr., told <a href=#>E! News</a>. "We don't know how to thank you for all the love you gave to Jenni and to all the family. It is just so special to have you guys as fans."</p><p>As family, celebs and fans are mourning her death, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> remembers the late singer's life and career with five facts.</p><p><strong>1. </strong>She sold over 15 million albums worldwide. The singer was nominated in 2003, 2008 and 2010 at the Latin Grammys. Rivera was the first female Banda singer (a brass-based form of traditional Mexican music) to sell out at the Gibson Amphitheater in Universal City, Calif. "I'm happy, I'm very happy for the success that I've had, but I've worked so hard at it," Rivera said in April at Billboard's Latin Music Conference (via <a href=#>CNN</a>).</p><p><strong>2. </strong>The daughter of Mexican immigrants, she was born and raised in Long Beach, Calif. Rivera, with one sister and and four brothers.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>She is survived by five children. Rivera became pregnant with her first child in high school. She had three children with first husband Jose Trinidad Marin: Janney, Jacqueline and Michael. After the couple divorced in 1992, she remarried in 1997 and had two children with second husband Juan Lopez: Jenicka and Johnny. "Being a mother by far is my favorite and most important career," she told <a href=#>Parade</a> in August 2012. "They take priority over anything else."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>She was a reality television star. Rivera appeared in and produced mun2's Jenni Rivera Presents: Chiquis & Raq-C in 2010, I Love Jenni in 2011 and Chiquis 'n Control in 2012. "People kind of connect and identify with us because we are normal," Rivera told <a href=#>Parade</a> in August 2012 of her reality show. "We're just like another other Mexican-American family. We are kind of nutty and silly."</p><p><strong>5. </strong>She was set to star in her own ABC show, Jenni. According to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, she was going to star in the self-titled family comedy as a middle-class, single woman raising a family with unique parenting skills.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtm6%2ByK%2Bcq5ldanq1tMinnqxlqaTCbrDOp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWknbJuuMCtnGarmaO0pr6Ma2dqamFlfnN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marvel-reveal-iron-mans-phone-number-call.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Marvel Reveals Iron Mans Phone Number And You Can Call It Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dalton-gomez-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dalton Gomez</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
