She was age 69.</p><p>The actress was found dead in her Lake Worth Beach, Florida, residence by her roommate on December 30, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reports.</p><p>The roommate told the Palm Beach Sheriff‚Äôs Office that she returned home from a holiday and knocked on Morgan‚Äôs bedroom door. She didn‚Äôt hear a response, but she smelled a strong odor from inside and called 911. The authorities entered Morgan‚Äôs room and found her body.</p><p>Morgan was last seen alive by her roommate on December 19.</p><p>The authorities told TMZ that they believe Morgan died of ‚Äúnatural causes‚Äù and found no evidence of foul play. An investigation is still ongoing.</p><p>Prior to her death, Morgan was best known for her first film role as Lacey Underall in the 1980 comedy Caddyshack opposite<strong> Chevy Chase</strong> and <strong>Bill Murray</strong>. Her character was the country club owner‚Äôs niece, who catches the attention of many men at the venue. She also starred in the sci-fi classic Tron, which hit theaters in 1982. She played Lora/Yori, <strong>Jeff Bridges</strong>‚Äò love interest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cindy-Morgan-in-Caddyshack.jpg><p>She also appeared on hit TV series including The Love Boat, CHiPs, Matlock and The Larry Sanders Show as well as 16 episodes of Falcon Crest. She produced a trio of sci-fi movies that she starred in in the 1990s (Out There, Amanda & the Alien and Dead Weekend).</p><p>Though she stopped acting onscreen in the early 2000s, Morgan was a regular at fan conventions and enjoyed talking about her past work.</p><p>‚ÄúSweet photo from the set of #Caddyshack,‚Äù Morgan <a href=#>captioned a still</a> from the set of the film via Instagram in June 2023. ‚ÄúBill Murray‚Äôs calmly advising me, and I look as nervous as I should be, playing #LaceyUnderall against four of the funniest men on the planet.‚Äù</p><p>She added, ‚ÄúWhat was Bill like? A sweet, big brother who kept me out of trouble‚Ä¶ mostly. üòâ.‚Äù</p><p>In a <a href=#>November post</a>, she revealed that she had two Falcon Crest roles after not telling producers she‚Äôd had a smaller part a few seasons prior.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>‚ÄúOne of the other actresses thought I looked a little too much like her, so she had me rinse my hair auburn,‚Äù Morgan recalled. ‚ÄúThe producers asked me when my new hair color would be permanent. I told them as soon as my contract was permanent.‚Äù</p><p>She added, ‚Äú16 episodes total, two characters. I also ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to tell the producers that I had been on the show before as Lorenzo Lamas‚Äô is love interest. One of the crew recognized me though. Interesting doing a nighttime soap. An emotional roller coaster, and I slapped a lot of people. Kissed a lot of others.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZSZxrS0wJyiZquklr9ur8inm7JlnaS%2FqK3NZp2orZ6ZeqWxwJ1kmqxdlrSmeZVyZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1997-dodge-viper-gts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>1997 Dodge Viper GTS</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./when-was-bachelor-in-paradise-2021-filmed-season-7.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>When was Bachelor in Paradise 2021 filmed (season 7)?
