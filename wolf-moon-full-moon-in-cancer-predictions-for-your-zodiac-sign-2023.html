ET.</p><p>In terms of numerology, 2023 is a seven and the tarot card associated is The Chariot. This card represents the need to gain command over our emotions in order to navigate thoughtfully and progressively in our relationships with others and on our path to personal actualization.</p><p>This paradigm becomes increasingly important under a Cancer full moon when emotions run high and our proverbial feels run deep, deep, deep. Cancer is ruled by the moon and when the full moon falls in this sign we are at our moodiest and moon-iest. Think belly aches, blue notes and increased nipple sensitivity.</p><p>Ruling the fourth house of home and root systems, Cancer is the most nostalgic sign in the zodiac, a bit of a blessing and a bane depending on where and how you cast your reflective lens. Idealizing a lost relationship? Candy coating your childhood? Self-destructive wistfulness? These tendencies might pacify us in the present moment but serve only and ever to paralyze our progress. This courting of what has been is enhanced by the ongoing influence of Mercury’s retrograde in Capricorn, itself a time of backspinning and a return/retreat to the intangible past.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>With every new year we are newborns and as such get to choose how and why and with what degree of tenderness and structure we raise ourselves.</p></figure><p>Yet, while this retrograde and this lunation ask us to look back they encourage us to do so with the clear intention of building from it, rather than longing for it. For more insights into what the month ahead and 2023 at large holds for your sign, be sure to read your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2023 horoscope</a> as well as<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> sex and love predictions for each sign in 2023</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">major predictions for the whole damn world in 2K23</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Full moon in Cancer 2023</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">This full moon occurs in the moon ruled sign of Cancer. <span class=credit>Composite: Shutterstock</span></figure><p>The full moon in Cancer coincides with the sun shining in boot strapping, belt tightening, legacy building Capricorn. In astrology, Capricorn and the sun are synonymous with the father while Cancer and the moon are associated with the archetype of the mother. When these parental luminaries are in cahoots, our childhoods, the wounds we incurred during them and the insecurities we carry out of them are high on the horizon.</p><p>Yet, we are also presented with the divine opportunity to reparent ourselves. With every new year we are newborn and as such get to choose how and with what degree of tenderness and structure we raise ourselves. My preferred exercise for this lunation is to write a list of what you needed as a child and weren’t given (don’t show your mom) and see how and if you can give yourself those things in some literal or metaphorical way this year.</p><p>How can we take responsibility for reparenting and fulfulling ourselves and how can this emotional autonomy prepare us to love others from a place of desire rather than desperation? Heavy themes but ones that set the tone for the year to come.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the spiritual meaning of the Wolf Moon in 2023</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Lone wolves aren’t seeking solitude but rather a new kind of pack. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>January’s full moon is known as the wolf moon as it is believed the howling song of these pack predators can be heard most clearly in the earliest month of the year. The spiritual symbolism of the wolf again recalls lessons of autonomy, communion and actualization. The term “lone wolf” is a bit of a misnomer as wolves are pack animals that strike out on their own not because they prefer solitude but rather because they seek something more, somewhere beyond; to find a mate, their own territory or to form a pack of their own.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>This moon is about howling to who you want to be and listening closely to the echo of your future self.</p></figure><p>I encourage you to consider the modality of the wolf under the light of this moon. If you have bound yourself to an ancestry, blood line, relationship or family tie that is limiting you in any way you have the right and the responsibility to retreat into the company of yourself with the express purpose of finding out and firming up what you need. Ther pack, place and partner you deserve await you on the other side of this wilderness. This moon is about howling to who you want to be and listening closely to the echo of your future self.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The full moon in Cancer calls bulls to reevaluate how they communicate. <span class=credit>iStockphoto</span></figure><p>This full moon pushes the bruises and buttons of your fourth house of home and ancestry asking you to consider the ways the past, and past versions of yourself are preventing you from moving forward. If all of your elders have failed you, channel an ancestor you’ve never met and move through the world with their history and healing it, as your fuel.</p><p>The wolf moon in your third house of communication means that you might be tasked with talking about, rather than brooding over, your feelings my bull babies. Rabble rousing punk rock Uranus in your sign forms a sextile to the moon and indicates that the way you relate to information and relay it to people may change wildly and for the better. This newfound language might shock you but trust, its a jolt in the right direction.</p><p>This full moon in watery Cancer is bringing to the surface resentments and attachments of the financial variety. Do you feel unappreciated on the job front? Are you putting in more than you’re getting out in terms of energy and income? Figure out what being seen and feeling financially secure look like for you and then trust in your divine right to both.n</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The full moon is high time for Leos to rest and restore. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Full moon and full shine in your sign, Cancer which can make you want to retreat into the dark, safety of your proverbial shell. Your “gut” feelings may be heightened during this lunation and while feelings are not facts, they are indicators of our conditioned responses and now is as good a time as any to explore what yours are and if they are helping or hindering you.</p><p>This full moon is a particularly introspective one for you lions. The moon is sending its silver into your twelfth house of the unconscious mind and spiritual inclinations. In all likelihood the past few weeks have been a flurry of social activity and energetic exchanges. The time is nigh for retreat and reflection. Have yourself a cat nap and a hard reset.</p><p>This full moon falls in your eleventh house of friends and community. Given the influence of this Mercury retrograde you could see a reemergence of old ghosts rather than new faces. Proceed with caution but also deep appreciation, interacting with people from your past can serve to remind you how far you’ve come from who you once were. But take heed, no backsliding bull***t allowed.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">You’re coming out of the dark (and possibly into a wind machine) under this full moon, Scorpio. <span class=credit>Getty Images/iStockphoto</span></figure><p>The full moon in Cancer shines its moody light on your tenth house of career and public image. This lunation is a time to discern who you are and how you wish to be remembered apart from what is expected of you and who you are trying to please, Libra. Professional success without personal fulfillment is like a candle with no wick.</p><p>This full moon sees you coming out of the proverbial long night of the soul and into the strange shores of new adventure and expanded thought. Whether your journeys are of the literal or metaphorical variety the time is nigh to take the first step. Be open to having your mind blown and your maps burned.</p><p>This lunation is pouring moonlight on your shadows and your eighth house of sex, death, and regeneration. You’re the first to go it alone Sag, ever ready to drive your own getaway car but this full moon is a chance to consider whether your independence is a hinderance to the kind of intimacy that will push your boundaries of bravery in a whole new direction.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Eat well, be well, think well this full moon, Aquarius. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Partnerships and the contracts we honor within them will take center stage for you during this full moon, Capricorn. You have a mind for business and if you apply the same savvy and level headedness to your relationships you can renegotiate, reconsider and reimagine them. Settle on new terms that better serve all parties.</p><p>You’re more often in your thoughts than in your body, Aquarius but this full moon takes place in your sixth house of physicality and daily routine. You would do well to remember that how you treat the temple machine of your body is in direct proportion to how the labyrinth of your mind will open itself. Slow down, savor wholly and above all show your mortal coil that it is loved and valued.</p><p>The full moon is disco balling in your fifth house of romance, pleasure seeking and good time having, Pisces and it’s about damn time. Love need not be the stuff of torture and pained poems, it can be the pulse of fun and simple joy; you only have to close the door to pining and to open the window to possibility.</p><p><strong>Astrology 101: Your guide to the star</strong></p><p>Astrologer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reda Wigle</a>&nbsp;researches and irreverently reports back on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign.
