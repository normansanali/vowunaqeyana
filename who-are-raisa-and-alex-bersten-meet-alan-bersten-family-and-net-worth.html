Alan Bersten is an American professional Latin and ballroom dancer. He is most known for his appearance on the hit dancing reality show Dancing with the Stars.</strong></p><p>The dancer began dancing when she was seven years old. Alan made his professional debut as a contestant on the tenth season of So You Think You Can Dance. He was a finalist on the show and proceeded to the top six after a brief stint at the top. The dancer returned to his most famous show, “Dancing with the Stars.”He first appeared in Season 20 and has now become a Professional Partner since Season 25 after four years as a regular participant.</p><h2><span id=Who_are_Raisa_and_Alex_Bersten_Alan_Berstens_Parents_Age_Difference>Who are Raisa and Alex Bersten? Alan Bersten’s Parents’ Age Difference</span></h2><p>Alan Bersten is Raisa Bersten’s and Alex Bersten’s son. On May 26, 1992, in Minnetonka, Minnesota, the lovely dancer was born. His two siblings were Gene, his brother, and Dr. Melani, his sister. He is the Berstens’ youngest child. The attractive dancer is of mixed ethnicity due to his Russian parentage.</p><p>His brother Gene is a dancer who debuted in SYTUCD S10. He was Alen’s first dance instructor, as well as a role model for his brother and parents, whom he credits with his success. His mother, Raisa, works at Abbott Northwestern Hospital. However, his father’s job is still unknown.</p><p>His parents got married on June 21, 1996, and they recently celebrated their 36th wedding anniversary. His father is also a talented dancer. There is no precise information on his parents’ ages; nonetheless, there does not appear to be a major age difference between them.</p><h2><span id=Alen_Bersten_Relationships_And_Girlfriends>Alen Bersten Relationships And Girlfriends</span></h2><p>Since his debut as a professional partner in the show, Alen has been affiliated with several of his dance partners. His dating life before the show is unknown. Alan has kept in touch with some of his dancing partners throughout the years. During S28, his dancing partner was Hannah Brown.</p><p>After a rough start, the duo improvised a lot and went on to win the championship; it was claimed that their off-stage connection was one of the key factors in the shift. Both dancers later clarified that these were just rumors and that their relationship was platonic; similarly, he was matched with model Alexis Ren in the previous season.</p><p>This time, though, they both freely confessed their love for one another throughout the show, only to split up a few weeks later. Other names have since been attached to the dancer; nevertheless, the dancer has yet to announce if he is devoted to someone; the dancer is now single.</p><h2><span id=Alan_Berstens_Net_Worth>Alan Bersten’s Net Worth</span></h2><p>The professional dancer and choreographer has established himself as one of the best in the business. Alan has made a fortune from his talent, and his net worth is estimated to be around 1.8 million dollars, according to the Net Worth study. The dancer is a family man who is grateful to his family, especially his parents, for their support and advice since the beginning of his career.</p><p>Alan and his partner Amanda Kloots finished fourth in the 30th season (2021 autumn). Meanwhile, he revealed his partner for the 31st season in an Instagram post barely a week ago; this time, his partner is Jessie James Decker, and the dancer is motivated to go all the way for the second time on DWTS.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
