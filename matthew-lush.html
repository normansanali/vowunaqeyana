There, he is seen in his most raw and unabashed self. Even though Lush is the icon of all things insane and hilarious, his journey to finding this stage was a rather rocky one, filled with anguish and trauma.</p><p>Growing up, his gay and vegan lifestyle attracted a lot of hate, especially from his mother and friends. The downtrodden eventually started looking for a friend over the internet. And to his relief, he found an online chat friend who lived across the state.</p><p>During this time, he fell in love with his first boyfriend and then created a ‘MySpace’ page. It was created just to post and share pictures of this newfound romance with the unknown internet clan. Before things could pick up the pace, his page found a boom of followers that loaded him with appreciation and love. And many of them even hailed him as the ‘Gay God.’</p><p>With an idea that struck him like a bolt, Lush changed his ‘MySpace’ name to ‘GayGod’. Soon after moving in with a friend, he started a YouTube channel. And then, uploaded eccentric videos that shot him to the 7th Most subscribed channel at that time.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-48287 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Matthew-Lush-video.jpg alt="Matthew Lush" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-48287 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Matthew Lush while making a YouTube video.

Now gaining popularity as one of the biggest pro-LGBT YouTubers, his channel ‘GayGod’ now has over one million and counting subscribers.</p><p>A channel that is no less than uber-cool and may probably even come off as provocative. ‘GayGod’ is surely on its way to becoming the best one-of-a-kind pro-gay YouTube channel out there.

It is an outlet for his wild thoughts like ‘I’m in love with a straight guy, and ‘Why I’m giving up on drinking’. No doubt these channels are making their way into the hearts of a wider number of fans by the passing day.</p><h2><span id=Matthew_Lush_8211_Personal_Life>Matthew Lush – Personal Life</span></h2><p>Lush is openly gay and is one of the most popular gay YouTubers of this generation with his enthusiastic pro-gay videos and his no-nonsense attitude.</p><p>Matthew is never one to keep his personal life hush-hush. Ever since he started a relationship with Nick Laws, his channel was brimming with PDA-overloaded videos and vlogs. And that didn’t hide any bit of their blooming romance.</p><p>The couple, unfortunately, called their relationship off. And Lush even shared a rather emotional video ‘Thoughts of committing suicide’, where he is seen overcome with a ton of emotions. They briefly dated for over two years. After a few months, he is seen in his ever-vibrant self again. And, in 2016, he began dating Chandler Murphy.</p><p>Moreover, according to some online sites, it came to know that he has also dated Connor Jon, and Max lately.
