Nowadays, it’s perfectly acceptable to connect with your hairstylist (and other salon professionals) via mobile device. But while they might feel like your BFF when you’re in the salon chair, there is a certain protocol for these kinds of texting relationships. To avoid any faux pas (or an awkward moment at your next appointment), we suggest brushing up on your texting etiquette. Before you hit “send,” keep these rules in mind:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Do Keep It Professional</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If and when a stylist offers you their phone number, it’s totally OK to initiate a texting relationship, says Devin Toth, a hairstylist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Salon SCK</a> in New York and spokesperson for Rowenta Beauty. Just try to keep the conversation as professional as possible, especially if you’re a new client. “I do give my cell phone number on occasion to my clients, mostly clients who have been with me for years whom I've developed a relationship, and also some newer clients whom I am developing relationships with,” adds Ray Symons, Master Stylist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Mizu</a> in New York. Though it’s perfectly fine to send holiday wishes and apologize for running late, you probably shouldn’t update them on your boyfriend drama until your next visit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Don’t Ask for an Appointment</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scheduling your next service via text message seems convenient, but to ensure you get the date you’re hoping for, you’ll want to contact the salon. “Whether it’s scheduling dates and times or inquiring a price quote for a specific service, it’s always best to have that conversation with the receptionist at the salon’s front desk because they are the experts with the numbers, dates and times the way your hairdresser is the expert with your hair,” Toth explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don't mind if my clients text me asking if I'll be in the salon on the day they want to come in and then contact the salon directly for the appointment,” says Symons. “Also, it's always good to reschedule or cancel via the salon and not via text.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Do Reach Out for Emergencies</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While you can’t expect your stylist to drop everything at any given moment, if you find yourself in a bind, it couldn’t hurt to reach out. “I do think that it’s OK to text your hairdresser for a last minute appointment (i.e. you’re going on vacation tomorrow morning and your hair is a mess) because your hairstylist might be able to squeeze you into a small gap of their day for that special circumstance,” says Toth. With that said, not all emergency situations can be accommodated. “I once had a client who messaged me at 10:30 at night, asking me to come over and give her hair a fresh blowout because her water had just broken,” he shares. Needless to say, this is one memorable request the pro politely declined.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Don’t Expect an Immediate Response</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before you start flooding their inbox, understand that your stylist has a life and might not be able to get back to you right away. “I think it’s always OK for a client to contact his or her hairdresser, no matter what time of day it is. That being said, it doesn’t mean the hairdresser will respond at all, especially if they are receiving these texts after work hours or during the middle of the night. Overall, it’s a good idea to be considerate of your hairstylist’s home life.” Symons, on the other hand, prefers when clients stick to daytime hours (or at least not at 2 a.m. when they’re stumbling out of the bar).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Do Refer a Friend</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you know somebody who’s in the market for a hairdresser, shoot your stylist a text and let them know you’ll be sending a friend to the salon. They’ll appreciate the business and the fact that you trust their talent enough to spread the word.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Don’t Hesitate to Thank Them for Their Work</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Obsessed with your new look? A simple “thank you” is enough to brighten up any hairstylist’s day. “I love receiving positive text messages from clients expressing how happy they are with their new hairstyle, especially when a great selfie I can share on social media is included,” says Toth. “Thoughtfulness is always appreciated!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGejlrmwuoyeq6KppZrBtbGMrZyxrJmjtG7Fzq6pZqCRnr%2B0wNiloKys</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-kelly-clarkson-show-season-3-episode-104-release-date-and-time-countdown-when-is-it-coming-out.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Kelly Clarkson Show Season 3 Episode 104 Release Date and Time, Countdown, When Is It Coming Out</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./page.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Spicy Chipotle Cornbread</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
