Wishing you all the best … All love, Shaq,” he wrote on Wednesday, May 8, captioning the upload, “Trust me I get it.”</p><p>Henderson and O’Neal tied the knot in 2002, separating five years later. Following a brief reconciliation in 2007, Henderson <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in 2009.</p><p>Henderson noted in her memoir that she “was in love with the idea of being married to the man I had a family with” and “was in love with the idea of building a life together.” She added, “I truly did enjoy spending time with him. [NBA] road trips gave me a chance to be with my husband and experience the NBA life for a little while.”</p><p>The exes share sons Shareef, 24, and Shaqir, 21, as well as daughters Amirah, 22, and Me’arah, 18. They also coparent Henderson’s son Myles from a previous relationship, and O’Neal shares daughter Taahirah, 27, with ex <strong>Arnetta Yardbourgh</strong>.</p><p>Henderson noted that because O’Neal was “trying to be a world-famous, thirty-something multimillionaire with thousands of women throwing themselves at him” while also “being a husband and a father,” their relationship ultimately fizzled out.</p><p>“I enjoyed those sweet early years being a mother and raising my children; my days were always busy with kids and family, and every now and then I got to travel or enjoy a little of the NBA high life,” Henderson wrote. “But invisibly, my marriage was beginning to crumble.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the wake of Henderson’s revelation, some of <a href=#>the former couple’s kids</a> took to the comments section of O’Neal’s post to share messages of support.</p><p>“Love you man! You saved my life,” Shareef wrote, while Shaqir added, “You know i love ya twin.”</p><p>O’Neal also received praise from several famous pals, including <strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong>. “Hey now. We all have a sociopathic ex,” Beckinsale, 50, wrote. “I got you — want me to pull up and snatch a wig or two? I will … love you man.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGmwqq4y55kqKaVlrluvsSsp6imlKh6tbuMnq9mr5mbsrR5zJqpq6GRnLJuvsSvnKWZpJ68r3nIp2Snnadir7C7ymg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-boyfriends-how-many-has-she-had.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Has Had 12 Boyfriends: Here's Everything We Know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sean-avery-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sean Avery Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
