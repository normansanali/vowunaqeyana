Like many actors, Franco began his career appearing in commercials, but soon snagged a role in the cult classic television series Freaks and Geeks. His career wasn’t the only one to get a boost from the underrated show as he appeared alongside an incredible cast that included future stars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Busy Philipps</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Seth Rogen</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Linda Cardellini,</a> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Starr,</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Segel</a>. Two years later, his performance as James Dean earned him a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Globe</a>, sealing his reputation as an up-and-comer.</p><p data-characters=807 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>From there, Franco’s career went from strength to strength. He appeared in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tobey Maguire</a>-led Spider-Man series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Knocked Up</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Milk</a>, and a slew of other hits that continued to raise his profile. In 2010 he was nominated for an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Academy Award</a> for his performance in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">127 Hours</a>, and four years later he earned another nomination — this time for Best Supporting Actor — thanks to his work in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harmony Korine’s</a> indie hit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring Breakers</a>. During this time he also produced a string of excellent theater performances in a Broadway production of John Steinbeck’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Of Mice and Men</a>, where he played George. Franco has also carved out a perception of himself as somewhat of a renaissance man, producing short stories, directing his own projects, and even hosting the Oscars alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anne Hathaway</a></p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it hasn’t all been smooth sailing for Franco</a>. He’s also been accused of using his power as an acting coach and big name to coerce women into sexual acts, although he and his legal team have denied all charges. In 2021 he did admit to having consensual sex with some of his students, and said he has been in rehab for sex addiction since 2016. After a long hiatus, Franco has recently been cast as Fidel Castro in the upcoming film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alina in Cuba.</a></p><h2 data-injectable=false>How many brothers does James Franco have?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Franco-bros.png><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=841 data-injectable=true>James Franco is the oldest of three brothers. His siblings are Tom and Dave Franco, who are both also active in Hollywood. Their mother, Betsy Lou, is a children’s book author with some acting credits to her name, and their father, Douglas, is a businessman who worked in Silicon Valley. The family has many other creative roots, with Douglas’s mother Marjorie having a career as a successful YA author, while Betsy Lou’s mother Mitzie owned the Verne Art Gallery, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles’s</a> premiere destination for Japanese art.</p><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Despite acting not playing a massive part in their childhood, all three Franco boys have worked as actors and remain active in the film, television, and theater industries. They grew up in Palo Alto in a comfortable middle class home. Although their mother is Jewish, James Franco revealed in a 2009 interview their home was a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">secular one</a>. While James was the first to jump into acting, Dave and Tom both soon followed. James is the eldest brother and was born in 1978. Tom was born two years later in 1980, and Dave half a decade after that in 1985.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is Tom Franco?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tom-franco.png><p data-characters=581 data-current-count=881 data-injectable=true>Tom Franco is the middle Franco brother. He began his acting career at age 10 with a small part in the 1990 comedy horror <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Basket Case 2</a>, but since then has only acted sporadically. Franco spends most of his time on Berkeley’s Firehouse Art Collective, where he’s a co-director. The collective is a community based project that seeks to give artists the space to produce content, and believes in interdisciplinary work and the powers of collaboration. Franco shared his directorship of the collection with his wife Julia Lazar Franco until she sadly passed away in 2014.</p><p data-characters=584 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>The Firehouse Art Collective currently has five locations spread across Berkeley, offering everything from studio space to music rehearsal rooms. They also run regular artsy events for people of all ages, including free group music lessons for children and gallery shows for local artists. Franco last acted in the horror film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miracle Valley</a>, where he had a small part as a cult member, although his biggest role was probably alongside his brothers in the 2017 film adaptation of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Disaster Artist</a>, based on the book of the same name about the infamous hate-watch classic, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Room</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is Dave Franco?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Alison_Brie_Dave_Franco.jpg><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>The youngest of the three Franco brothers, Dave Franco is an established actor in his own right. Originally, he wanted to be a high school teacher, but while he was a sophomore at the University of Southern California he was persuaded to get into acting by James’ manager.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Franco’s first big break came in 2006 when he was given a role in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CW</a> drama <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">7th Heaven</a>, and within a year he produced an acclaimed performance in the iconic 2007 high school comedy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Superbad</a>. In 2009 he was given a major role in the ninth season of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scrubs</a>, and while his performance earned great reviews, the show was ultimately cancelled.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=731 data-injectable=true>Franco’s profile rose into the stratosphere in the 2010s, when he worked on a string of blockbuster hits like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">21 Jump Street</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Now You See Me</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lego Movie</a>. In the first half of the decade he was also a regular in the web comedy series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Funny or Die</a>, usually playing himself. In 2020 he wrote, directed, and produced the horror film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rental</a> to generally positive reviews.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Franco is married to former <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Community</a> star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alison Brie</a>.
