On December 26, 2022, the series was published exclusively on Netflix.&nbsp;Matt Charman is the creator of the thrilling limited series. He also collaborated with Amanda Duke to write the series. Treason was directed by Louise Hooper and Sarah O’Gorman.</p><p>According to the Netflix miniseries’ official synopsis:</p><p>“When the past comes back to haunt the newly appointed chief of MI6, in the guise of a Russian agent with whom he has a convoluted history, he is forced to rethink everything and everyone in his life. Secrets, falsehoods, and diplomatic ties will be exposed.”</p><p>The series has received a lot of praise for its captivating plot, photography, and performance by the cast members, particularly Oona Chaplin as Maddy de Costa. Without further ado, let’s dive right in and learn all we can about the actress as Treason premieres on Netflix.</p><p></p><h2>Learn about actress Oona Chaplin, who plays Maddy de Costa in Treason.</h2><p>Oona Chaplin, 36, is the daughter of famed actress Geraldine Chaplin and acclaimed cameraman Patricio Castilla. She is the granddaughter of Charlie Chaplin, the famed actor, and director. She is also the great-granddaughter of the famed Irish-American writer Eugene O’Neill. The Spanish-Swiss actress is most recognized for her roles as Jess in the 2013 film Powder Room, Ruth Levinson in the 2015 film The Longest Ride, Jeanette in the popular TV series Sherlock, Talisa Maegyr in Game of Thrones, and Zilpha Geary in the 2017 TV series Taboo.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Oona-Chaplin-1.jpg alt="Oona Chaplin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Oona Chaplin has also appeared in Quantum of Solace, Pelican Blood, The Devil’s Double, Imago Mortis, What if…, Realive, Aloft, Dancing for My Havana, My Dinner with Hervé, Anchor and Hope, Purgatorio, Inconceivable, and a few more films and television shows.&nbsp;Other notable TV shows in which she has appeared include Married Single Other, The Hour, Inside No. 9, The Comey Rule, The Crimson Field, Dates, Black Mirror, Made for Love, Spooks: Code 9, and a few more.</p><p>Oona Chaplin discussed Treason and her character Maddy de Costa in a recent interview with Hello Magazine. She stated:</p><p>“Treason is a traditional espionage program in some aspects, but it’s also a family drama in others. And I guess what I enjoy about it is that it delves into what it’s like to be a spy in the upper offices of MI6. As a result, the kids, Ella and Callum, play an important role. Then there’s Maddy, Adam’s wife, and she’s one of the most lovely and compassionate characters I’ve ever portrayed.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Oona-Chaplin-2.jpg alt="Oona Chaplin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The actress went on to say:</p><p>“Her capacity for love is enormous. As an example, she has adopted Charlie’s children. They’re adult children, but the way she loves and cares for them and is really, truly there for them in really deep and significant ways motivated me to learn from that character.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGimqKaRYrCprc%2BloKdlmah6sbvRramasZWZeqK%2FjJpkppmUmcZusMRmmqirpJZ6qrqMramemaOku3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-best-michael-pena-movies-and-tv-shows.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 best Michael Pea movies and TV shows</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicholas-anderson-just-getting-started.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicholas Anderson: Just Getting Started</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
