It's the idea that we should focus on being happy and healthy, instead of striving for what other people perceive to be happy and healthy bodies.</p><p>But learning to love yourself can be harder than it sounds, especially in a world that often teaches us to do just the opposite. With everything from television shows to your own family constantly insinuating that something (or everything) about you looks wrong, who can blame you for letting that negativity seep into your mind? Simply put, It’s not easy being a body image positive girl in a body image negative world.</p><p>But a few strong people are out there pushing back. Fighting discouragement with inspiration and insults with love. Whether its giving an inside look into somebody else’s world, zeroing in on society’s many ironies, or giving voice to indescribable emotions, spoken word poetry has a way of inspiring.</p><p>So for your bad days (we all have them), here is an annotated list of eight spoken word poems that are sure to have you filled to the brim with confidence and self-love.</p><h3>1. "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Shrinking Women</a>" by Lily Myers</h3><p></p><p>One poem that will blow your mind in four minutes or less. A powerful exploration of how generations of women pass down their insecurities to their daughters.</p><p>While men are taught to be loud and enthusiastic and take up space, women are taught to be quiet and good and small.</p><p><i>Nights I hear her creep down to eat plain yogurt in the dark,</i></p><p><i>A fugitive stealing calories to which she does not feel entitled.</i></p><p><i>Deciding how many bites is too many.</i></p><p><i>How much space she deserves to occupy.</i></p><h3>2. "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Pretty</a>" by Katie Makkai</h3><p></p><p>What her mother said to her, and what she’ll say to her daughter. Why are we more preoccupied with being pretty than being ourselves?</p><p><i>“Mom, will I be pretty? Will I be pretty?”</i></p><p><i>I will wipe that question from your mouth like cheap lipstick and answer,</i></p><p><i>“No!” The word ‘pretty’ is unworthy of everything you will be, and no child of mine will be contained in five letters.</i></p><p><i>“You will be pretty intelligent, pretty creative, pretty amazing. But you, will never be merely 'pretty'.”</i></p><h3>3. "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Ana</a>" by Sierra DeMulder</h3><p></p><p>In case anyone was curious what the “Pro-Ana” movement is. Google it. Then watch this woman tear it down.</p><p><i>There is nothing empowering about lessening yourself.</i></p><p><i>You are a vanishing act.</i></p><p><i>Your body, the magic hat,</i></p><p><i>pulling out nothing.</i></p><p><i>Your body is a clothing rack,</i></p><p><i>your body is my favorite sweater shrunk in the drying.</i></p><h3>4. "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Fat Girl</a>" by Megan Falley</h3><p></p><p>Somehow, in just three minutes this poem takes its listeners through the entire emotional rollercoaster that is the lifelong journey towards self-acceptance. Humor, anger, and pride included.</p><p><i>Fat girl, pretty face.</i></p><p><i>Fat girl, Dean’s list.</i></p><p><i>Fat girl want fries with that.</i></p><h3>5. "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Dear Ursula</a>" by Melissa May</h3><p></p><p>Ursula may have been the ultimate villain, but for so many little girls, she was also the only Disney character they could identify with it. And as if that contradiction wasn’t hard enough, when the toy line came out, she’d been downgraded to a size zero.</p><p><i>And while you may not have had the waist-line of a princess I'll be goddamned if you didn't have the swagger of a Queen.</i></p><p><i>The way you sashayed around your lair in full makeup black flamenco number cut so low in the back that your every twist and shimmy displayed the gorgeous tuck of your rolls.</i></p><p><i>You made back-fat look fucking sexy.</i></p><h3>6. "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>10 Thoughts on Being Loved by a Skinny Boy</a>" by Rachel Wiley</h3><p></p><p>Can being seen as beautiful by one person outweigh the knowledge that you are seen as ugly by the rest of the world? Or does it just make it impossible to believe?</p><p><i>The phrase “Big girls need love too” can die in a fire.</i></p><p><i>Fucking me does not require an asterisk.</i></p><p><i>Loving me is not a fetish.</i></p><p><i>Finding me beautiful is not a novelty.</i></p><p><i>I am not a fucking novelty.</i></p><h3>7. "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Full Figure Potential</a>" by Georgia Me</h3><p></p><p>One woman who is finished with hate and disgust directed at her for merely existing as a big woman in a small world. Everyone judges her size and doesn’t take the time to meet the person within.</p><p><i>My personal demons are hard by themselves</i></p><p><i>Comparisons to pigs, elephants and whales</i></p><p><i>You might look at me and see lazy and weak</i></p><p><i>Giving no second thought, that before you an angel may speak</i></p><h3>8. "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>The Body is Not an Apology</a>" by Sonya Renee</h3><p></p><p>Everyone has something they want to change about their body. Whether its size, color, ability, age, we all seem to have something we want to fix. We act as if our bodies are a mistake in need to correction, and never thank them for all the good they do for us.</p><p><i>The body is not a crime; is not a gun.</i></p><p><i>The body is not a spill to be contained.</i></p><p><i>It is not a lost set of keys, a wrong number dialed.</i></p><p><i>It is not the orange burst of blood to shame white dresses.</i></p><p><i>The body is not an apology.</i></p><p><i>Images: Elizabeth Minch/Bustle</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyhJZwbGllaGKvsLDYZqeoq5mptrexjKmmnqWjYsGprdOlo2aqlaK2r7CMsqauZaSkeqe7wq6qZqeeYsCmuMVmo6iulQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anne-hathaway-net-worth-2024-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anne Hathaway Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lyrics-zach-bryan-november-air.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zach bryan november air lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
