He’s been active in the music industry since 1973, and has won several awards.</p><p>How rich is Gino Vannelli? As of mid-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $3 million, mostly earned through success in the music industry. He’s released a total of 19 albums including a live album and as he continues his endeavors, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Gino Vannelli Net Worth $3 million</h3><p>Gino grew up in a musically oriented family. At a young age, he wanted to be a drummer after watching <a href=#>Buddy Rich</a> and Gene Krupa, and while at high school, he played drums as part of a pop band. At the age of 17 in 1969, he was signed to RCA Records under the name Vann Elli. He also attended McGill University to study music theory.</p><p>Vannelli moved to Los Angeles to pursue his music career and out of desperation waited outside the parking lot of A&M Studios for a possible record deal. He eventually ran into <a href=#>Herb Alpert</a>, and had to evade security guards to give him a demo tape. Herb then decided to sign Vannelli to the label, leading to his first album called “Crazy Life” which was released in 1973. His popularity started to grow, and he became one of the first Caucasians to appear in the dance show “Soul Train”. The following year, he toured in support of <a href=#>Stevie Wonder</a>.</p><p>In 1976, Gino released the album “Gist of the Gemini” and followed it up two years later with “Brother to Brother”, which included the Billboard charting song “I Just Wanna Stop”, which proved highly successful and propelled his net worth, plus leading him to be nominated for a Grammy Award. He also released another top 10 hit in “Living Inside Myself”. During the 1970s, he won three Juno Awards, two of which were for best male vocalist, and along with his brother and musical partner Joe Vannelli, also got a Juno Award for Best Production in 1979.</p><p>He continued to release successful singles in the 1980s, but did not tour during this period. In the 1990s, Gino then shifted from jazz pop to acoustic jazz music, releasing the albums “Yonder Tree” and “Slow Love”, and the song “Parole Per Mio Padre (A Word to My Father)” which caught the attention of Pope John Paul II, leading him to perform it at the Vatican. This led him to produce a disc with BMG Records which is considered one of his strongest musical works, creating songs in French, Spanish, Italian, and English.</p><p>In 2008, Vannelli became part of the spotlight again through the Boston Celtics team of the National Basketball Association (NBA). During that season, each blowout home victory would feature a disco dancer wearing a Gino Vannelli T-shirt which was called “Gino Time”. One of Vannelli’s latest projects is the compilation “Live in LA” which marks the first collaboration of the Vannelli brothers after many years.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Gino has been married to Patricia since the 1980s and they have a son. The family resides in Oregon.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=27.157894736842><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Gino Vannelli</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 16, 1952</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Montreal, Canada</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Composer, Lyricist, Conductor, Songwriter, Musician</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>McGill University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Canadian</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Patricia Vannelli</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Anton Vannelli</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Delia Vannelli, Russ Vannelli</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Joe Vannelli, Ross Vannelli</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Gino Vanelli , Gine Vanelli , Vannelli, Gino</td></tr><tr readability=0.30188679245283><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/GinoVannelliOfficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/ginovofficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/ginovannelli</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1218212/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.24242424242424><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gino-vannelli-mn0000948061</a></td></tr><tr readability=18><td>Awards</td><td>Juno Award for Recording Engineer of the Year, Juno Jack Richardson Producer of the Year Award, Juno Award for Best Male Artist, Juno Award for Most Promising Male Vocalist of the Year, I Just Wanna Stop, Living Inside Myself, Hurts to Be in Love, Scottsdale, AZ, United States, Pasadena, CA, USA, Co...</td></tr><tr readability=19><td>Nominations</td><td>Juno Award for Single of the Year, Juno Award for Album of the Year, Juno Award for Songwriter of the Year, Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, I Just Wanna Stop, Living Inside Myself, Hurts to Be in Love, Scottsdale, AZ, United States, Pasadena, CA, USA, Coachella, CA, United States</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=15.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>Tyler, The Creator: Buffalo</td><td>2015</td><td>Short writer: "Find Your Wings"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Behind the Candelabra</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Movie performer: "Living Inside Myself" / writer: "Living Inside Myself"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>This Beat Goes On: Canadian Pop Music in the 1970s</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Movie documentary performer: "I Just Wanna Stop"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Banda sonora</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series performer -
