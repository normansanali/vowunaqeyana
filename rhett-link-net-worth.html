According to authoritative sources, this YouTube comedy duo has net worth of $3 million, accumulated from their career in the mentioned field which really began professionally in 2001. Being YouTubers, they get paid every time an ad is displayed with their videos.</p><h3>Rhett & Link Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>Rhett and Link first met in 1984, in first grade at school in Harnett County, when both of them had to attend detention, as they doodled on desks. Later, they doodled mythical creatures, such as &nbsp;unicorns together, – that’s where the name of their series ‘’Good Mythical Morning’’ comes from – and later swore that ‘’they will do something together some day’’. When they were 14 years old, Rhett and Link began writing the screenplay for their film ‘’Gutless Wonders’’, and then began shooting it, however, although the film was never finished, the script was read several times in their show ‘’Good Mythical Morning’’.</p><p>During their high school days, the duo filmed a parody of ‘’Oedipus Rex’’, in which Rhett played Oedipus and Link played his father’s servant. &nbsp;Besides being interested in cinematography and acting, they were members of The Wax Paper Dogz, the punk rock band which performed at an Independence Day festival. During their college days, the duo remained together and became roommates, after which Link worked at <a href=#>IBM</a> for a short time, and Rhett for Black & Veatch. However, both decided to quit their jobs and dedicate to YouTube, kicking off their channel in 2008 with the video ‘’The Bloody Door’’ – which has been viewed more than half a million times – and followed by uploading ‘’Super Note Live Begins’’ shortly after that. In the following period, the duo continued releasing new videos, and their channel progressed well. In 2010 they uploaded the video ‘’Meet Lindo, Link’s Baby’’, which attracted more than 3.3 million views, and in 2012 they officially started the series ‘’Good Mythical Morning’’, the first episode under the title ‘’Extremely OCD Morning Routine’’, followed by the release of ‘’Strangest Name In History’’, also a part of the series.</p><p>When it comes to their most important videos, the most viewed video so far has been ‘’Eating A Scorpion – Bug War Challenge’’ with 26 million views, and after that, ‘’World’s Hottest Pepper Challenge – Carolina Reaper’’.</p><p>Overall, their main channel has more than 12 million subscribers and their videos have been seen more than 3.8 billion times, which has certainly played a significant role to their finances. Throughout their careers, they’ve collaborated with notable brands such as Gillette, Taco Bell, and Wendy’s, making a whole music video commercial for the latter. Rhett and Link are also doing podcasts, and are active in the music field, having released two comedy albums including ‘’Just Mail Us the Grammy’’. The duo also starred in ‘’Rhett & Link: Commercial Kings’’, made by IFC. In 2017, they enlarged their resume by publishing ‘’Book of Mythicality’’, which appeared on The New York Times Best Seller List.</p><p>When it comes to their private lives, being YouTubers they naturally share a lot of information with their audience. Both of them are married – Rhett to Jessie and Link to Christy – and they talk about their romantic lives in one of their videos, released on Valentine’s Day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjsLC5jqufnqykYrmquspmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rina-sawayama-record-label.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rina Sawayama Record Label</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nikke-goddess-of-victory-announces-chainsaw-man-collaboration.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>NIKKE x Chainsaw Man Collaboration Announced</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
