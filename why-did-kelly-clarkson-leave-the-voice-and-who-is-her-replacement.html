Since then, fans have speculated if over 20 seasons was simply two too many, or if the show had a second wind in it. Well, as it turns out, there’s still more life yet in the popular singing competition, as The Voice is back today, September 25, for season 24, with some alterations to the judges’ selection.</p><p data-characters=654 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>While millions are ecstatic over the show’s return, news of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kelly Clarkson’s</strong></a> departure, which came out back in May, had many fans both up in arms and downright downhearted. The former American Idol had been a staple on the show since 2014, taking up the mantle Adam Levine once held and one Blake Shelton removed this year to pass on to Reba McEntire, who admitted to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET</a> that filling the country singer’s chair is not going to be an easy feat. Clarkson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">also commented</a> on Blake’s absence this season praising what “he’s done for so many Artists,” and how his departure is “a loss for&nbsp;The&nbsp;Voice.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=838 data-injectable=true>Very much like Shelton, and although this is not her first absence since she did not take part in season 22, Clarkson’s playful, lighthearted, and humorous presence will be sorely missed this 24th season. She was always the first to bicker with Shelton, the first to say what was on her mind, and the first to relieve tense moments that sometimes happen on live TV. And, of course, we have to miss the creative team jackets she used to hand out in the blind auditions. So, why did Clarkson leave the show? Here’s what we know.</p><h2 id=h-why-has-kelly-clarkson-left-the-voice data-injectable=false>Why has Kelly Clarkson left The Voice?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Captura-de-ecra-2023-09-25-130206-1-1.png><p id=d8f14c1b-74a2-4134-94b5-174aa110e1ca data-characters=192 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>No official statement has been given by Clarkson or NBC as to why the four-time winning coach is not returning to the singing competition. This leaves us to speculate based on what we do know.</p><p id=d8f14c1b-74a2-4134-94b5-174aa110e1ca data-characters=819 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>The news came not long after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> wrote that The Kelly Clarkson Show was going to move across the country from Los Angeles to New York. Thankfully, the show has no end in sight, with it being renewed through 2025. However, the fact that season 5 of Clarkson’s daytime talk show is going to be hosted on the opposite coast from The Voice, makes it so there’s a schedule clash and likely creates an impediment for the singer to be able to juggle both. In addition, there is a chance that, as reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> back in May, the revelation that 11 staffers who’ve worked on The Kelly Clarkson Show had serious complaints about the show’s producers – thankfully none against the host – has Clarkson more dedicated than ever to establish a good work environment for all those involved.</p><p id=d8f14c1b-74a2-4134-94b5-174aa110e1ca data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false>Going further back, in January 2022, Clarkson expressed on The Kelly Clarkson Show‘s Instagram Live the desire to spend more time with her children, saying:</p><p>“I’ve decided this year there’s just going to be a couple of changes for me that I can’t say here. There’s a couple things happening. I’ve been able to make more time just for me and my kiddos and still be able to work. Just where we can get away on weekends and really do some fun stuff with my kids. Because they only want to hang out with you for so long and that’s now so I got to take advantage of that… I’m excited to have more time with them.”</p><p id=d8f14c1b-74a2-4134-94b5-174aa110e1ca data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Several months later, Clarkson said in an interview on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elvis Duran Show</a>, “I turned 40 and you know what I’m giving myself for 40? I literally said ‘no’ to everything this summer. I will not do anything this summer. Since I was 16 years old, I haven’t had a summer off. This is my first summer off. I am taking time.”</p><p id=d8f14c1b-74a2-4134-94b5-174aa110e1ca data-characters=811 data-current-count=1147 data-injectable=true>Clarkson’s personal life has been in the headlines for quite some time. In 2020 the singer filed for a divorce from Brandon Blackstock, to whom she’d been married for seven years. The two share two children, River Rose Blackstock, and Remington Alexander Blackstock. As of March 8, 2022, after two long years and many more headlines, the two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">finalized their divorce</a>. So, it would come as little surprise that she would want to save some time in her busy schedule for her family. Her hiatus from season 22 of The Voice, could also probably be explained by the reasonable presumption that Clarkson had to have been working on her tenth and latest studio album “Chemistry.” A few of the albums’ emotionally charged songs seem to allude to the singer’s split from her ex-spouse.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>There’s no doubt that her radiant personality will be sorely missed, but also her noteworthy talent. Clarkson is hailed by many as one of the best live singers in the industry, and she justified those opinions with appearances on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">When Christmas Comes Around on NBC</a> in which she sang live with former Voice judge, Ariana Grande.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=false>In season 22, Clarkson was replaced by Camilla Cabello, who had served as John Legend’s guest judge the season prior. Legend is in this latest season 24, whereas Cabello is not. Along with Legend, Shelton’s wife and pop icon Gwen Stefani, Niall Horan, and the already mentioned Shelton’s replacement, Reba McEntire, make up the four coaches for this rendition of the beloved singing competition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmm6KcXaCyrbjYZpqlmaKgwLC6jKWcmq6VYsGpsYyvpqKblWKur7CMsJ%2BoZZmoeqmx0WapnqiclrCmucSnq2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bridgerton-wet-shirt-scene-homage.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bridgerton's Wet Shirt Scene Was an Homage to 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Bridget Jones'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./unannounced-8th-generation-core-15w-u-series-cpus-appear-on-intels-price-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Unannounced 8th Generation Core 15W U-Series CPUs Appear on Intels Public Price List</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
