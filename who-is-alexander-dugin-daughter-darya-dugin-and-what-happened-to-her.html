Here is everything you need to know about the recent headline.</p><p>With the current conflict between the Russians and Ukrainians over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it is imminent that both sides have lost something of great value.</p><p>Numerous lives have been lost, along with collateral damage to properties. The recent one of great significance in that list is the daughter of Putin’s ally, Alexander Dugin. Dugin’s daughter, Darya Dugina, fell victim to the latest bomb attack in Moscow, where her car burned to flames.</p><p>BBC&nbsp;reports that the lady was traveling back home with her father, who decided to travel in a different vehicle at the last moment. Soon as they approached their destination, the car in which Darya was traveling burst into flames, eventually taking her life.</p><p>Several media portals have circulated the news since the happening as more people are aware of the explosion. Here is everything to know about Darya Dugi.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Who Was Darya Dugi?

Alexander Dugin Daughter Car Bomb Attack Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Darya Dugi, real name Darya Dugina, was a journalist and Alexander Dugin’s daughter who died in the Moscow car bomb attack.</p><p>She was a prominent journalist and commentator who supported the&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;invasion and previously spoke in its favor, reports BBC. Although she was not directly involved with the charge and other activities, her reporting in favor of the attack certainly riled up many people with rage.</p><p>However, the reports fail to justify if the attack was intended toward the lady. Since Darya and her father, Alexander, were due to travel in the exact vehicle, but the man changed his transport at the last moment, it remains doubtful if the attackers planned the explosion for the father.</p><p>Alexander is a close ally of Putin, often earning the nickname “Putin’s brain” or “Putin’s Rasputin.” Whoever the bomb was planned for, Darya lost her life in the explosion after her car exploded in flames on her way back home.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darya-dugi-age-how-old-was-she></span>Darya Dugi Age: How Old Was She?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alexander Dugin’s daughter Darya Dugi was 30 years old at the time of her death.</p><p>The official sources reporting on the news of her death have mentioned that the lady was 30 during her death. However, they fail to publicize her actual date of birth. So, further details such as her birthday are missing from the outsiders’ knowledge.</p><p>Likewise, more information about her early age and childhood life is also behind the curtains.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-darya-dugi-have-a-boyfriend></span>Did Darya Dugi Have A Boyfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whether Darya Dugi had a boyfriend or not remains an unknown piece of information at the moment.</p><p>Although she was a journalist who liked to comment on current affairs and disclose unknown sides of the story to the public, the lady was pretty clear in keeping a thick line between her personal and professional life. As a result, she never really opened up about her love life.</p><p>There are no details about her romantic life and relationships on the web, and nothing relatable can be found on social media. Thus, her love life was a mystery even though many would expect her to have a present or past relationship at her age.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yao56wkaOxpr6MnaygoZ5isaLBxqGrnqpdma6zxcBmm66fmaN6orrDZq6hmaRitaK8z56lnpxdqbxutMSrZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-lil-saint-death-cause-omarion-drama-and-meme-explained-335498-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Lil Saint?
