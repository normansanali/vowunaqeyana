When<a href=#><strong> Eddie Redmayne</strong></a> first met <strong>Hannah Bagshawe</strong>, they weren’t even considering getting married — they were simply teenagers at neighboring schools.</p><p>Before he was an actor, Redmayne attended Eton College alongside <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a>, and the boys in their class were invited to a local all-girls school to help with a charity fashion show. While the event was awkward, it ended with a meet-cute worthy of Hollywood.</p><p>“It was an embarrassing evening,” he recalled to the<a href=#> Daily Mail </a>in 2014. “I had to walk across the stage topless — I was this pasty, freckly guy and when I came on the girls in the audience didn’t take much notice of me, but I was followed by the best-looking boy in the school and all the girls erupted in cheers, which was emotionally scarring!”</p><p>Luckily, something great came out of the night — the<a href=#> Fantastic Beasts star</a> met his future wife. “I saw Hannah across the room at a party afterward and she was very beautiful and very funny and she loves the arts and theatre just as I do, so we became friends,” Redmayne explained.</p><p>Bagshawe, a <a href=#>PR executive in finance</a>, remained his pal for more than a decade. Everything changed when Redmayne was about to start filming Les Miserables and invited the University of Edinburgh alum to travel to Italy with him.</p><p>“Before I went, Hannah and I were on a sort of date — we’d been good friends for 12 years — and we had a wonderful evening and I suddenly said, ‘You don’t want to come to Florence with me next week, do you?’ She said, ‘That’s absurd, you don’t mean it.’ I said, ‘Yes I do!’ So our first <a href=#>proper date</a> was in Florence,” he said, adding that the two “couldn’t be happier” at the time.</p><p>After a couple of years together, the Theory of Everything actor asked his girlfriend to marry him in May 2014 while on vacation. “He had been planning on it for a while,” an insider <a href=#>told Us Weekly</a> at the time. “They have a very relaxed and supportive relationship … they seemed to have always known they were going to spend the rest of their lives together.”</p><p>The duo wed in an intimate ceremony at the Babington House in Somerset, England, in December 2014, his rep <a href=#>confirmed to Us</a>. The candlelit ceremony had a “Winter Wonderland” theme, but the Oscar winner later revealed that the bride’s track record had many of their guests nervous.</p><p>“She has never been on time for anything in her life,” Redmayne said during an appearance <a href=#>on The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> a month after exchanging vows. “She was a good half-hour late. Her grandfather had to be some help from going and summoning her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added, “Everyone else was really stressed, but I was kind of relaxed knowing that she’d never been on time for pretty much anything in her life.” The two enjoyed their <a href=#>honeymoon</a> in The Alps after they said “I do.”</p><p>Scroll down to see their entire relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksqWwyJ5kq52Uoq66usRmmKecXZ2ur7rAoWSbmZeotaLDxKxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXam2rrHLoqWeZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bobs-burgers-thanksgiving-episodes-ranked-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Every Bobs Burgers Thanksgiving Episode, Ranked</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./duane-kuiper-age-wikipedia-biography-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Duane Kuiper Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
