For one, I feel bad about the way I went about the situation with Dom. She’s so sweet but I really just didn’t know how to handle it all. I didn’t want it on TV, and I guess I really didn’t value how seriously she took us. So in turn, she feels embarrassed and betrayed. That’s my fault.”</p><p>She added: “There are so many things that I regret — little decisions really — I feel like I let myself down, my kids down, and I just want to refocus on myself and my family.”</p><p>The MTV personality <a href=#>revealed that she had a girlfriend</a> in November 2017 during her appearance on the Coffee & Convos with <strong>Lindsie Chrisley</strong> podcast. She shared why her relationship with Potter ended in January via Twitter on Saturday.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dom & I dating – I wasn’t trying to deny her or a relationship. & we had fun while it lasted but things didn’t work out.

I’ve learned a lot over the years and wanted to keep things private & off the show but I don’t think I really handled it properly,” Lowry tweeted.</p><p>“I have been feeling a lot of regret lately and i can say i haven’t made some of the best choices over the last few months & Doing so on camera & then reliving them all over hasn’t ever been easy,” the Love is Bubblegum author continued. “I really want to focus on growing myself and my brand and work on eliminating all toxic people and situations from my life. So for anyone, fans & supporters included, that I’ve hurt or offended, I apologize. Sometimes i have to look at a situation & be honest with myself & i don’t think I’ve handled things the right way lately. Soooo I’m starting over.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She <a href=#>added</a>: “Also – don’t lead people on. I’ve been lead on & I’ve lead people on. Nobody benefits from it. Hooking up with someone else won’t get you over your ex.”</p><p>In the slew of tweets, she also addressed her relationship with ex-husband <strong><a href=#>Javi Marroquin</a></strong> and revealed that they recently considered getting back together. The pair were married in 2012 but split in 2016. Marroquin, 25, recently revealed that he’s <a href=#>having a baby</a> with girlfriend <strong>Lauren Comeau</strong>. The pair got back together in March after his split from <strong><a href=#>Briana DeJesus</a></strong> in January.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZmhxq95y6iuq7FdpL2mutJmrKllkZe8tsCMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZq%2BZqbVusM6moKehoaqybrzOraueql8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kowloon-brawl-video-brawl-at-kowloon-restaurant-saugus.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kowloon Brawl Video 2023, Brawl at Kowloon Restaurant Saugus</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hunter-moore-net-worth-2024-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hunter Moore Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
