In addition to appearing on Ex on the Beach and The Challenge, Faith <a href=#>added mother to her résumé</a> in February 2020 when she welcomed a son with boyfriend<strong> Marcio Marchena II.</strong></p><p>Faith <a href=#>made headlines in June 2020</a> when she spoke out about being the only person of color to have a prominent role on Vanderpump Rules.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was a lot,” she said via Instagram Live, noting that her costars went “easy” on Jax for their affair, but came for her. “They wanted to attack me instead of him. They wanted to attack, attack, attack, attack, attack. I was wrong, I was this, I was that, calling me names, saying my hair was nappy, which is weird coming out of their mouths.”</p><p>The former SURver added that she was disappointed that she didn’t get the chance to film any confessionals for season 4.</p><p>"It could be different on their end, but in my opinion, I thought it was weird that everybody on the show got to do interviews and confessionals and I didn't even get a chance to do that, to tell my story,” she said. “Which was a very interesting story, being a black woman in the military at the time. At the time I was still in the army. … I didn't feel like they appreciated that."</p><p>In June 2023, Faith started a GoFundMe to help her with legal fees so she could pursue "justice against Stassi." Faith previously claimed in 2020 that Stassi and Kristen had falsely reported her to the police years prior for a crime she didn't commit. Stassi and Kristen were <a href=#>fired from Pump Rules</a> as a result of their actions.&nbsp;</p><p>In a June 2023 statement to Us, Faith said, “I believe Stassi hasn’t learned from her mistakes and is still alleging in her book that I have committed a felony. This is harmful to my career and to my family. Enough is enough. I <a href=#>found an amazing legal team</a> and we are seeking assistance from supporters that also stand against bullying and racial divide to once and for all end this matter."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Brrq%2BwxKunrqWgYr%2B2uMSsZKyskafAbsPHqGSlnZaperW0xGaqnqqZmsBuw8eeqZ5lkaeybsDHnrBmpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-two-tickets-to-paradise-ranks-among-all-of-julia-roberts-rom-coms.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>We Ranked Julia Roberts' Rom-Coms.
