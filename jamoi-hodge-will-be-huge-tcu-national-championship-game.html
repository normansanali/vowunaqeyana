They will meet defending champions Georgia in the College Football Playoff Championship Game as they attempt to claim their first national title since 1938.</span></p><p class=p1><span>Several players have come up huge in TCU's Cinderella run to the national championship game. Linebacker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamoi Hodge</a> is one such player, and he will be a huge factor for the Horned Frogs in the big game against the Bulldogs.</span></p><p class=p1><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamoi Hodge</a> has been one of the leaders of the TCU defense in their first season under head coach Sonny Dykes and defensive coordinator Joseph Gillespie. The redshirt junior linebacker built upon his strong sophomore campaign this season as he has recorded 75 total tackles with 3.5 sacks, which are both third on the team.</span></p><p class=p1><span>TCU’s “bend-but-don’t-break” defense will face its toughest test to date with Georgia’s prolific passing attack. The Horned Frogs are not known for putting pressure on the quarterback with their 3-3-5 formation, but they will have to find a way to keep Stetson Bennett from getting too comfortable in the pocket.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamoi Hodge</a> and fellow linebacker Dee Winters will be crucial in this respect as they will be tasked with pass-rush duties from time to time. And with 11 combined sacks this season, the two are certainly capable of disrupting Georgia’s passing game.</span></p><p class=p1><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamoi Hodge</a> will also be vital in pass coverage, particularly against Georgia running back Kenny McIntosh. Aside from being the Bulldogs' leading rusher with 779 yards and 10 rushing TDs, McIntosh is also third on the team in catches with 42 for 505 yards and two more TDs. But with his elite quickness and athleticism, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamoi Hodge</a> has the tools to keep McIntosh in check.</span></p><p class=p1><span>It will take a complete team effort for TCU to win the national title, though, so Hodge and the Horned Frogs need all the support they can get. And you can show your support for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamoi Hodge</a> before, during, and after the title game by visiting his fan store on Fan Arch.</span></p><p class=p1><span>Check out his cool collection of merch, which is complete with shirts, hoodies and sweatshirts that you can wear as TCU take on Georgia.</span></p><p class=p1><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamoi Hodge</a>, along with 1000+ professional athletes and influencers have personalized merchandise on the Fan Arch’s website!</span></p><p class=p1><span>Fan Arch aims to transcend the narrative by making it easier to bridge the gap between athletes, influencers, and their fans.
