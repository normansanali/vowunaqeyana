She loved to sing and dance from a young age, so she started performing at local talent shows. It wasn't long before she was doing commercials, and in 1989 she got a part <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">alongside Jennifer Love Hewitt on Disney's Kids Incorporated.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, in 1992, Fergie joined the all-girl band Wild Orchid.

In 2006, she released her debut solo album, The Dutchess. The album was a massive commercial success, with hit singles such as "London Bridge," "Glamorous," and "Big Girls Don't Cry."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Dutchess earned critical acclaim and cemented Fergie's status as a solo artist.

In 2009, she started her shoe line, "Fergie Footwear," with Brown Shoe Company. She told Fashion Magazine that her shoe line is like a metaphor for her. "Walk your path with pride; walk it with confidence." Fergie is the perfect example of someone who walks with confidence, so this is definitely true for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fergie also got into the wine business when she became a co-owner of the winery Ferguson Crest with her father in California's Santa Ynez Valley in 2013. She was very involved in it with her family and had a lot of unique names for the wine. This was her father's dream, and it did very well in the sales department. Sadly, Fergie decided to part ways with the winery after the death of her father in 2021. According to Architecture Digest, it sold for around $3.7 million.</p><h2 id=fergie-39-s-personal-life-and-divorce><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Fergie's Personal Life And Divorce</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fergie-4.jpg><p>Fergie's personal life has been the subject of public interest. She married actor Josh Duhamel in 2009, and the couple welcomed their son, Axl Jack Duhamel, in 2013.
