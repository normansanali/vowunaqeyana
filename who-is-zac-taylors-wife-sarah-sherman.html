Per <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>Sports Illustrated</a>, Taylor met his wife in Nebraska in 2004 when she was a graduate assistant working in media relations. Taylor said when he first caught sight of Sarah, he was surprised by how "mature" she looked. "I figured she was probably 30 years old," he told SI, noting he was 22 at the time. "As the years went by, I learned we were the same age. I would run into her more often and I realized maybe I had a chance."</p><p dir=ltr>The two eventually went on to date, but for Taylor, meeting his father-in-law was not an easy task. "The first time I met [Mike], he was upstairs in his house," he recalled to SI. "He has his XOS coaches film set up there. I was as intimidated as can be. I figured, I can impress him by watching film with him." However, things didn't go as planned, as Taylor couldn't make small talk with him and couldn't answer any football-related questions he asked, which is ironic given his position today.</p><p dir=ltr>Still, Taylor eventually got Mike's approval and <a href=#>wed Sarah in 2008</a>, when they were both working at&nbsp;Texas A&M University.&nbsp;And&nbsp;they've been expanding their family ever since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG5kaYJ3e9ahpmaho2LHoq%2BMrZiypJ%2BnwG7DyJ%2BcZquRp66pedKhnKulkaN8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pierce-brosnan-wife-keely-shaye-stuns-black-gown-30th-anniversary-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Pierce Brosnan's wife Keely Shaye stuns in a black gown as she celebrates 30th anniversary with love</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./brittney-griner-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103530-html.html>Brittney Griner Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dekker-edward-gosselaar.html>Dekker Edward Gosselaar - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dennis-and-trinity-rodman-a-sporting-familys-journey-as-a-soccer-superstar.html>Dennis and Trinity Rodman: A Sporting Family's Journey as a Soccer Superstar</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erika-christensens-husband-cole-delivers-her-second-child.html>Erika Christensen's Husband Cole Delivers Her Second Child</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./401919-eva-marcilles-fans-get-emotional-and-did-html.html>Eva Marcilles Fans Get Emotional &amp;amp; Did Not Expect Her Divorce from Michael Sterling</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
