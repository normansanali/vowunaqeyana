Her Twitter vacillates between comedy, politics, and the kind of self-aware commentary that most celebrities always seem to lack. The best content comes from Lynda using gifs of her previous work to make a delightful joke. Remember when social media was fun? Lynda Carter does.</p><p>Beyond her online presence and acting chops, Lynda is many things. She is a singer, humanitarian, advocate, recovering alcoholic, and mother. This <a href=#>Wonder Woman</a> also shares two children with her late husband, lawyer and video-game executive Robert A. Altman, and is not shy about shouting them out on her wildly popular Twitter. Let's meet Lynda Carter's kids, who probably had to dodge a lasso of truth or two while growing up.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Lynda Carter's kids? She has a son and a daughter.</h2><p>On Jan. 15, 1988, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">South Florida Sun Sentinel</a> ran a birth announcement for Lynda Carter's son simply titled Wonder Baby. James Clifford Altman was born Thursday, Jan. 14, weighed seven pounds, and was the first child Lynda had with her attorney-turned-media-mogul husband Robert.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Lynda and Robert married in 1984. "He makes me laugh," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Closer Weekly</a> in 2018. "When I get into my minutia, he brings me off the edge!"</p><p>Robert was co-founder and chief executive of ZeniMax Media (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>), which is the parent company of the successful video game publishing company Bethesda Softworks. The company was sold to Microsoft in October 2020, and less than a year later, Robert passed away in February 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">open letter to colleagues on the Bethesda Softworks website</a>, James spoke of his father as both a friend and colleague. He ended his missive by sharing a few life lessons he learned from his dad. First and foremost, "Nothing in life is as important as family and friends. Nothing else actually matters," wrote James. Secondly, if you live a life of integrity you will always sleep well at night. And finally, "discipline and hard work are more important than talent."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Speaking of talent, Lynda Carter's daughter Jessica Carter Altman is a singer like her mom.</h2><p>Jessica Carter Altman was born two years after her brother, and while he followed in his father's footsteps, she took after her mother. Jessica grew up in Potomac, Md., alongside her brother and parents, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>. She has both a bachelor’s in psychology and a law degree from University of Michigan, and spent a few years working as a litigator at Gibson Dunn in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>In April 2020 Jessica finally worked up the courage to pursue her real passion: music. She has since released a couple of EPs and a full-length album. Jessica got married in May 2023 to her partner, Dr. Ross Uhrich, who was immensely supportive of her career change. She and her husband "split their time between Washington, New York and Nashville, where Ms. Carter Altman’s producer is based," reported the Times.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet from Oct. 19, 2023</a>, Lynda Carter wanted to remind everyone what matters most to her in this world. "My favorite role in life is mom and my second favorite is, mother," she wrote.
