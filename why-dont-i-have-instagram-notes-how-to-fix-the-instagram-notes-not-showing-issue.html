But some users are complaining and tweeting about problems with Instagram Notes, as shown below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>And the crazy thing is that the notes don‚Äôt appear on my Instagram üòÇ https://t.co/RO7O5T978L</p><p>‚Äì Jalaü§© (@jala____) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">December 14, 2022</a></p><p>In this article, we‚Äôll walk you through everything you might want to know about Instagram Notes and issues like ‚ÄòInstagram Notes not showing‚Äô around them. So let‚Äôs get started and start by talking a little bit about what exactly Instagram notes are.</p><p>Content</p><ul><li>Instagram Notes: Overview</li><li>Why are Instagram notes not showing?</li><li>How to get Instagram notes?</li><li>final thought</li><li>Frequently asked questions</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Instagram_Notes_Overview>Instagram Notes: Overview</span></h2><p>Since almost every other social media platform is constantly rolling out new and exciting features, it‚Äôs no surprise that Instagram‚Äôs Instagram notes. After a period of testing, Instagram introduced the Notes feature, allowing users to post quick notes with the content disappearing.</p><p>Just like the Instagram Stories feature, notes also disappear after 24 hours. Launching in December 2022, you can add a short message of up to 60 characters to a note. Although it has been available for many reasons, not everyone knows about it and its uses. In fact, some users are facing the problem of not being able to post on Instagram.</p><p>Users can share their thoughts in quick notes with their added buddy list or with their followers and the people they follow on Instagram. It‚Äôs a fun way to interact with others and see what they say when they share their thoughts.</p><p>The Instagram Notes feature is loved by many users and many have used it. However, some users complain that Instagram notes are not displayed. To answer the question ‚Äòwhy don‚Äôt I have notes on Instagram?‚Äô, first consider the reasons and understand why this might be the case.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Why_are_Instagram_notes_not_showing>Why are Instagram notes not showing?</span></h2><p>Unlike DM on Instagram, the Notes feature on Instagram is exactly the opposite. While you get a notification when someone messages you on Instagram, Instagram notes stay hidden in your inbox.</p><p>However, if for some reason you can‚Äôt see them, there‚Äôs a list of factors that can lead to the ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I see my Instagram notes‚Äù problem. They are listed below:</p><ul><li>You may have a bad network connection.</li><li>There is a problem with your device.</li><li>The update, which includes the Instagram Notes feature, has not been installed yet.</li><li>You may not add as a user‚Äôs best friend or unfollow each other.</li><li>Instagram Notes is not yet available in your region.</li><li>Your Instagram app is outdated.</li></ul><p>Here are some reasons why you might be wondering ‚Äòwhy is my Instagram not showing notes.‚Äô Now see the steps on ‚Äòhow to get Instagram Notes.‚Äô</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=How_to_get_Instagram_notes>How to get Instagram notes?</span></h2><p>Just like the Instagram Stories feature, the Instagram Notes feature is only available for 24 hours. It allows users to share their thoughts. So if you also want to share notes on Instagram and want to know how to get Instagram Notes, here is a step by step guide.</p><h3><span id=Check_your_messages>Check your messages</span></h3><p>Before you overthink your thoughts and let FOMO overwhelm you, make sure you‚Äôre looking for the right notes! Instagram is a pretty big place, and some people can get lost looking for the right options and features.</p><p>So you need to make sure that you don‚Äôt choose the wrong options for showing notes on Instagram, as they can only be posted and viewed in the DM. And if you‚Äôre looking for them on Instagram Feed, you‚Äôre missing them without a clue. Some users also experience ‚ÄòInstagram could not refresh feed‚Äô issue.</p><p>Now you know that instead of an Instagram feed, you need to see direct messages for Instagram notes. To find Instagram notes in your DMS:</p><table readability=1><tr readability=2><td>Solution summary: Instagram &lt; Messenger icon &lt; + icon on your profile picture</td></tr></table><p>Here you can also see the Instagram notes of other users who have shared them with you.</p><h3><span id=Update_Instagram>Update Instagram</span></h3><p>One of the most important things that people forget or often overlook or overlook is updating their apps. And the same can happen here for Instagram.</p><p>Since Instagram Notes launched in December 2022, there may be many people who have not updated the Instagram app and therefore cannot find them. So make sure to update your Instagram account with these steps:</p><ul><li>Go to the Play Store or the App Store.</li><li>Find Instagram.</li><li>Check if a new version is available.</li><li>If so, click Update.</li></ul><h3><span id=Make_a_list_of_close_friends>Make a list of close friends</span></h3><p>If you haven‚Äôt created a close friend list for your Instagram account, this could also be the reason why you can‚Äôt show your Instagram notes to others or why they can‚Äôt see your Instagram notes?</p><p>So, to create a close friend list on Instagram, follow the steps below:</p><ul><li>Go to Instagram and tap the profile icon.</li></ul><ul><li>Then click on the menu icon and select Close Friends.</li></ul><ul><li>Click Start.<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1693636174_618_Why-Dont-I-have-Instagram-Notes-How-to-Fix-the.webp.webp alt="Click Start." title=Tap-on-Get-Started..webp style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></li></ul><ul><li>When you‚Äôre ready to add friends, tap Add next to the user‚Äôs name and click Create List.<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1693636175_230_Why-Dont-I-have-Instagram-Notes-How-to-Fix-the.webp.webp alt="Tap Add and tap Create List." title=Tap-on-Add-and-hit-Create-List..webp style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></li></ul><p>Once you‚Äôve done this, check if you can now see your followers‚Äô Instagram notes or you can now add your own.</p><h3><span id=Try_switching_to_a_pro_account>Try switching to a pro account</span></h3><p>One way to solve the ‚ÄòInstagram notes not showing‚Äô problem is to switch to a professional account.

This is because the feature is still being tested in some locations, leading to an ‚ÄòInstagram Notes Not Showing‚Äô issue for some users.</p><p>If, after checking, you are sure that the feature has not been introduced and you still want to use it, there is a VPN option. Using any premium VPN, you‚Äôll most likely be able to get your hands on the Instagram Notes feature.</p><ul><li>Change your location/region to USA.</li><li>Sign out of your Instagram.</li><li>Now login again with your login details.</li><li>Check if you can use Instagram Notes now.</li></ul><p>We hope you should be able to use Instagram Notes by now, if not, move on to the next method.</p><h3><span id=Contact_Instagram_support>Contact Instagram support</span></h3><p>In the event that none of the methods explained so far work for you, then you are left with only one last option that may work.
