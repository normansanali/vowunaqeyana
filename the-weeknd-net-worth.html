Rose produced several songs that Tesfaye rapped on, and he uploaded them to YouTube, gaining a significant following and catching the attention of Drake.</p><p>Tesfaye’s first major release was the mixtape House of Balloons, which was a huge success and resulted in Drake approaching him with a plan to collaborate.
